(Outpatient, Yuekang Hospital)

29
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,322
Alright, Dad.

30
00:01:53,282 --> 00:01:55,163
Qu Mingcheng's land deal

31
00:01:55,523 --> 00:01:56,803
(Shouke & Jinda Accused of Bid-Rigging)
has been frozen by the authorities.

32
00:01:57,762 --> 00:02:00,163
There's no way to complete
the bet with the board.

33
00:02:00,322 --> 00:02:01,963
He will be in tough times.

34
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,243
He's like someone sprinting

35
00:02:07,282 --> 00:02:08,402
who suddenly trips

36
00:02:08,882 --> 00:02:10,882
and falls hard enough to get dazed.

37
00:02:11,282 --> 00:02:12,162
When he wakes up,

38
00:02:12,162 --> 00:02:13,323
he finds himself

39
00:02:13,323 --> 00:02:15,043
tied up tight.

40
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:17,602
All thanks to

41
00:02:17,682 --> 00:02:18,442
your cooperation.

42
00:02:27,722 --> 00:02:28,682
Regardless,

43
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:31,442
I've always

44
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:33,523
respected you.

45
00:02:33,722 --> 00:02:34,602
Well,

46
00:02:35,483 --> 00:02:37,442
we compete in business,

47
00:02:39,282 --> 00:02:40,083
but

48
00:02:40,763 --> 00:02:41,442
I genuinely

49
00:02:41,963 --> 00:02:43,562
hate seeing you like this.

50
00:02:44,643 --> 00:02:46,043
You don't need to say anymore.

51
00:02:47,483 --> 00:02:48,722
My dad can't hear you anyway.

52
00:02:49,562 --> 00:02:50,523
He's been unconscious

53
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:52,162
with no awareness at all.

54
00:02:53,643 --> 00:02:54,523
Haoming.

55
00:02:55,923 --> 00:02:58,483
Your dad had
a sudden cerebral hemorrhage.

56
00:02:59,323 --> 00:03:00,722
This wasn't foreseeable.

57
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:02,083
I also feel sad

58
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:04,083
to see him like this.

59
00:03:04,722 --> 00:03:06,162
That's why I came to visit him.

60
00:03:07,402 --> 00:03:08,243
Are you done?

61
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:10,763
My mom will be here soon.

62
00:03:11,043 --> 00:03:12,243
She won't want to see you.

63
00:03:14,043 --> 00:03:15,083
Alright.

64
00:03:18,243 --> 00:03:18,763
Well,

65
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:20,682
take good care of your dad.

66
00:03:21,763 --> 00:03:22,842
If you need anything,

67
00:03:24,043 --> 00:03:25,523
just let me know.

68
00:03:25,882 --> 00:03:26,483
Bye.

69
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:02,363
Who do you think

70
00:04:03,602 --> 00:04:05,083
acted better,

71
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:08,122
me or Qu?

72
00:04:09,243 --> 00:04:11,442
Of course, your acting is superior.

73
00:04:14,043 --> 00:04:14,602
Careful.

74
00:04:19,763 --> 00:04:21,123
Before the bidding concludes,

75
00:04:21,842 --> 00:04:23,003
I need you to stay

76
00:04:23,482 --> 00:04:24,842
at the hospital a while longer.

77
00:04:25,523 --> 00:04:26,242
Okay.

78
00:04:27,282 --> 00:04:28,123
I'll do that.

79
00:04:36,162 --> 00:04:37,563
Having me hospitalized

80
00:04:38,242 --> 00:04:39,683
was to make Qu Mingcheng

81
00:04:39,683 --> 00:04:40,602
drop his guard.

82
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,362
The board's bet with him

83
00:04:42,362 --> 00:04:43,482
was also your doing,

84
00:04:43,802 --> 00:04:44,323
right?

85
00:04:46,523 --> 00:04:47,963
Most importantly,

86
00:04:48,003 --> 00:04:48,963
most board members

87
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:50,282
support you.

88
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:52,722
I approached them privately

89
00:04:53,003 --> 00:04:54,323
with the proposal,

90
00:04:54,602 --> 00:04:55,523
and they agreed.

91
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:56,802
But

92
00:04:58,003 --> 00:04:58,883
one thing

93
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:00,282
puzzles me.

94
00:05:01,763 --> 00:05:02,643
Qu Mingcheng

95
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:05,003
and Huang Chuming's bid-rigging

96
00:05:05,162 --> 00:05:06,763
is internal information.

97
00:05:06,922 --> 00:05:07,683
It isn't something

98
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,282
just anyone could uncover.

99
00:05:16,963 --> 00:05:18,123
Very good.

100
00:05:22,443 --> 00:05:22,963
Mr. Huang.

101
00:05:23,842 --> 00:05:24,842
Qu Mingcheng

102
00:05:25,402 --> 00:05:26,722
has been officially arrested.

103
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:29,443
The Diamond Plot project

104
00:05:29,443 --> 00:05:30,602
involves massive funds.

105
00:05:30,683 --> 00:05:31,443
Qu Mingcheng

106
00:05:31,523 --> 00:05:33,162
won't escape legal punishment.

107
00:05:34,003 --> 00:05:35,123
This charade

108
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:36,763
is finally over.

109
00:05:38,402 --> 00:05:40,042
Without your personal involvement,

110
00:05:40,563 --> 00:05:41,802
Mr. Huang,

111
00:05:42,362 --> 00:05:43,802
our plan to take down Qu Mingcheng

112
00:05:43,922 --> 00:05:45,323
wouldn't have gone smoothly.

113
00:05:51,683 --> 00:05:52,643
Mr. Huang,

114
00:05:53,563 --> 00:05:54,602
why did you ultimately

115
00:05:55,003 --> 00:05:56,523
choose to work with me?

116
00:05:57,683 --> 00:05:58,722
Frankly,

117
00:05:59,602 --> 00:06:00,763
you and Shen Haoming

118
00:06:00,763 --> 00:06:02,042
offered similar terms.

119
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:03,443
But you have Jinda,

120
00:06:04,003 --> 00:06:05,922
so Shen Haoming stands little chance.

121
00:06:06,443 --> 00:06:07,883
I have one more condition.

122
00:06:08,643 --> 00:06:09,242
Go on.

123
00:06:10,282 --> 00:06:12,443
Beyond our agreed terms,

124
00:06:12,763 --> 00:06:13,683
I want

125
00:06:13,763 --> 00:06:15,802
the two companies you own
in Hong Kong, China.

126
00:06:21,722 --> 00:06:23,563
You're really asking for the moon here!

127
00:06:25,162 --> 00:06:27,323
This is my only additional condition.

128
00:06:30,203 --> 00:06:31,402
As you know,

129
00:06:32,523 --> 00:06:34,242
I spent years on those two companies.

130
00:06:36,802 --> 00:06:38,802
When you officially become Chairman,

131
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:41,402
you won't have time
to manage them personally.

132
00:06:41,643 --> 00:06:42,963
Those two companies

133
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:46,083
are crucial to
my development strategy there.

134
00:06:49,523 --> 00:06:50,083
Fine.

135
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:51,242
If you say no,

136
00:06:52,802 --> 00:06:53,963
I won't insist.

137
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:56,563
Are there other options?

138
00:06:57,523 --> 00:06:58,203
This time,

139
00:06:58,402 --> 00:06:59,802
I'll take risks with you.

140
00:07:00,443 --> 00:07:02,643
The compensation should
naturally be higher.

141
00:07:08,443 --> 00:07:09,802
You try putting.

142
00:07:12,763 --> 00:07:13,362
I can't.

143
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:14,602
He's greedy.

144
00:07:15,203 --> 00:07:16,602
I should be greedier than him.

145
00:07:16,763 --> 00:07:18,083
That's how I gained his trust.

146
00:07:19,162 --> 00:07:21,563
Judging by the situation back then,

147
00:07:22,162 --> 00:07:23,722
he did hold the upper hand.

148
00:07:24,282 --> 00:07:25,842
Just one thing has always puzzled me.

149
00:07:26,643 --> 00:07:27,602
Why did you

150
00:07:27,602 --> 00:07:29,003
choose to trust me?

151
00:07:31,042 --> 00:07:31,683
Firstly,

152
00:07:32,323 --> 00:07:33,563
he dragged me into bid-rigging.

153
00:07:33,802 --> 00:07:34,722
He made a mistake

154
00:07:35,123 --> 00:07:37,003
from the very start.

155
00:07:37,443 --> 00:07:38,083
Secondly,

156
00:07:38,523 --> 00:07:39,763
you were generous,

157
00:07:40,602 --> 00:07:41,482
meeting my requirement

158
00:07:41,563 --> 00:07:43,083
for mutual benefits.

159
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:44,802
Thirdly,

160
00:07:45,922 --> 00:07:46,963
I've done business

161
00:07:47,443 --> 00:07:49,203
for so many years

162
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:51,323
and have seen many people and things.

163
00:07:51,523 --> 00:07:53,083
But I meet

164
00:07:53,203 --> 00:07:54,763
very few trustworthy people.

165
00:07:55,003 --> 00:07:55,963
In life,

166
00:07:56,402 --> 00:07:58,563
genuine sincerity matters.

167
00:08:00,323 --> 00:08:01,123
Haoming.

168
00:08:02,443 --> 00:08:03,402
I admire both you

169
00:08:03,523 --> 00:08:04,722
and your wife.

170
00:08:05,162 --> 00:08:05,922
I believe

171
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,643
you'll go even further.

172
00:08:08,563 --> 00:08:09,203
Thank you.

173
00:08:15,563 --> 00:08:16,123
Yan.

174
00:08:18,402 --> 00:08:19,722
I just met Mr. Huang.

175
00:08:20,323 --> 00:08:21,042
It went smoothly.

176
00:08:24,323 --> 00:08:25,083
What?

177
00:08:26,362 --> 00:08:27,408
Fang Lei came to our home?

178
00:08:29,482 --> 00:08:30,003
Okay.

179
00:08:30,722 --> 00:08:31,563
I'll be back soon.

180
00:08:39,203 --> 00:08:39,683
Fang Lei.

181
00:08:40,963 --> 00:08:43,642
Why did you come?

182
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:03,242
Look at this.

183
00:09:16,762 --> 00:09:17,522
I'm sorry.

184
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:18,842
Haochen

185
00:09:19,482 --> 00:09:20,882
is not your child.

186
00:09:32,203 --> 00:09:33,642
I'm sorry?

187
00:09:37,882 --> 00:09:39,122
Speak!

188
00:09:43,362 --> 00:09:44,362
What's going on here?

189
00:09:48,362 --> 00:09:49,602
Explain this!

190
00:09:50,522 --> 00:09:51,242
Back then,

191
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,563
my sister suddenly came to me.

192
00:09:55,602 --> 00:09:56,563
She told me

193
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,122
she was pregnant.

194
00:10:02,722 --> 00:10:03,722
You are pregnant?

195
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,242
Whose child is it?

196
00:10:06,043 --> 00:10:07,002
I don't know

197
00:10:07,762 --> 00:10:09,842
if it's Shen Haoming's baby.

198
00:10:11,882 --> 00:10:13,203
Are you serious?

199
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:14,563
You and Haoming

200
00:10:14,563 --> 00:10:15,642
have already broken up.

201
00:10:16,842 --> 00:10:17,963
Yes, but we

202
00:10:19,963 --> 00:10:20,803
broke up

203
00:10:20,803 --> 00:10:21,722
just two months ago.

204
00:10:23,242 --> 00:10:24,403
Does he know?

205
00:10:27,283 --> 00:10:29,203
I can't confirm if it's his child.

206
00:10:30,283 --> 00:10:32,002
On the day we broke up, I went to a bar.

207
00:10:32,002 --> 00:10:32,642
Then,

208
00:10:33,362 --> 00:10:35,203
I met an ethnic Chinese artist.

209
00:10:35,522 --> 00:10:36,403
That night,

210
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:37,762
we both got drunk.

211
00:10:37,882 --> 00:10:38,642
And then...

212
00:10:40,482 --> 00:10:41,002
But

213
00:10:41,403 --> 00:10:43,403
it really only happened once.

214
00:10:44,762 --> 00:10:45,803
Who was that artist?

215
00:10:45,882 --> 00:10:46,762
Where is he now?

216
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:51,762
I didn't even keep his contact.

217
00:10:54,602 --> 00:10:56,122
What will you do now?

218
00:10:58,882 --> 00:10:59,563
Later,

219
00:11:02,122 --> 00:11:04,803
my sister came to you

220
00:11:05,722 --> 00:11:06,242
and told...

221
00:11:06,283 --> 00:11:07,122
Tell me!

222
00:11:08,283 --> 00:11:09,642
Why did the old paternity test

223
00:11:09,722 --> 00:11:11,283
prove that Haochen and I

224
00:11:11,683 --> 00:11:12,882
were father and son?

225
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:13,683
Why?

226
00:11:18,443 --> 00:11:20,803
It was all my fault.

227
00:11:23,522 --> 00:11:24,403
I thought

228
00:11:25,563 --> 00:11:26,842
as long as you kept believing

229
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:29,403
that Haochen was your biological son,

230
00:11:30,642 --> 00:11:31,482
you and I

231
00:11:32,482 --> 00:11:33,842
would never

232
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,642
be separated.

233
00:11:36,443 --> 00:11:39,762
And being together would feel natural.

234
00:11:40,762 --> 00:11:41,602
It was me.

235
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:45,203
After learning you

236
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:46,842
wanted a paternity test,

237
00:11:48,122 --> 00:11:50,762
I replaced the real test result

238
00:11:50,882 --> 00:11:52,482
with a forged one.

239
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,283
You're insane!

240
00:12:36,242 --> 00:12:38,122
I know I've been absurd and childish.

241
00:12:38,163 --> 00:12:39,762
Absurd? Childish?

242
00:12:40,362 --> 00:12:41,362
You're so selfish!

243
00:12:43,283 --> 00:12:44,882
I was scared.

244
00:12:45,122 --> 00:12:47,002
I know...

245
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,443
I know I was wrong.

246
00:12:48,443 --> 00:12:50,043
I truly feel sorry now.

247
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:50,882
I'm sorry.

248
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:52,683
I hurt Haochen.

249
00:12:54,563 --> 00:12:55,043
Look,

250
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,043
I'll go to Jinda right now

251
00:12:57,602 --> 00:12:58,522
and reveal

252
00:12:58,762 --> 00:12:59,963
Haochen's true identity.

253
00:13:00,522 --> 00:13:02,163
Then you and Mr. Shen

254
00:13:02,203 --> 00:13:03,762
can reclaim your board positions.

255
00:13:11,163 --> 00:13:11,923
Fang Lei,

256
00:13:13,283 --> 00:13:14,923
you're not even human.

257
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:18,683
Heartless creature!

258
00:13:20,122 --> 00:13:20,963
Have you ever

259
00:13:20,963 --> 00:13:22,242
considered Haochen's future?

260
00:13:22,362 --> 00:13:24,002
What will happen to him?

261
00:13:26,122 --> 00:13:27,122
Haochen has finally

262
00:13:27,122 --> 00:13:28,283
seen Haoming as his dad.

263
00:13:28,563 --> 00:13:29,203
Do you know

264
00:13:29,203 --> 00:13:31,083
how hard we've tried

265
00:13:31,163 --> 00:13:32,882
and how much he's done?

266
00:13:43,803 --> 00:13:44,762
Let me make this clear.

267
00:13:47,362 --> 00:13:48,362
No one will

268
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:49,283
hurt Haochen.

269
00:13:51,803 --> 00:13:53,362
He only stays with me.

270
00:13:53,923 --> 00:13:54,923
Got it?

271
00:14:03,722 --> 00:14:05,482
Haochen will always be my son.

272
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:08,563
Yan and I

273
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,083
are his parents.

274
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:12,482
This home

275
00:14:13,923 --> 00:14:15,122
is Haochen's home.

276
00:14:18,563 --> 00:14:19,882
I know, I know.

277
00:14:20,043 --> 00:14:20,602
I know.

278
00:14:21,163 --> 00:14:21,882
I'm sorry.

279
00:14:23,002 --> 00:14:23,762
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:24,882 --> 00:14:25,963
I'm terribly sorry.

281
00:14:26,242 --> 00:14:26,923
Sorry.

282
00:14:27,963 --> 00:14:28,803
Sorry.

283
00:14:31,323 --> 00:14:33,602
I'm truly sorry.

284
00:14:33,923 --> 00:14:35,722
I'm terribly sorry.

285
00:14:37,323 --> 00:14:38,122
Forgive me.

286
00:14:39,002 --> 00:14:39,722
My fault.

287
00:14:40,803 --> 00:14:41,642
My fault.

288
00:15:07,882 --> 00:15:08,482
Hello.

289
00:15:10,403 --> 00:15:11,602
I'm Han Weiping.

My business card.

291
00:15:16,963 --> 00:15:19,043
Currently, I'm working

292
00:15:19,163 --> 00:15:21,043
at a shell law firm as junior counsel.

293
00:15:21,842 --> 00:15:22,842
Contact me anytime

294
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:23,963
for legal matters.

295
00:15:25,882 --> 00:15:26,963
What else do you want?

296
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:29,762
Steve and Qu Mingcheng

297
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,683
have gone to prison.

298
00:15:31,522 --> 00:15:32,683
You should be grateful

299
00:15:33,602 --> 00:15:35,043
that they discarded you early

300
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,323
as their pawn.

301
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:38,923
Waiter!

302
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:40,163
Give her a glass.

303
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:43,283
Are you here

304
00:15:43,283 --> 00:15:44,443
to mock me?

305
00:15:44,803 --> 00:15:45,323
Fine.

306
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:46,762
Let's drink while you do.

307
00:15:47,403 --> 00:15:48,522
I'm returning to the UK.

308
00:15:53,923 --> 00:15:54,522
Go ahead.

309
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,043
Come with me.

310
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:06,683
I don't like enigmas.

311
00:16:08,043 --> 00:16:09,242
However, I know

312
00:16:09,842 --> 00:16:10,963
you're obviously a bad man.

313
00:16:13,043 --> 00:16:14,443
To keep you from hurting others,

314
00:16:15,403 --> 00:16:16,762
I'd better keep you in sight

315
00:16:17,882 --> 00:16:19,283
under my control.

316
00:16:28,043 --> 00:16:29,482
You have one day to decide.

317
00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:42,002
(Conference Room)
Haoming,

318
00:16:42,642 --> 00:16:44,842
though Qu Mingcheng is gone,

319
00:16:45,283 --> 00:16:46,642
your family's scandal

320
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:48,043
severely damaged

321
00:16:48,043 --> 00:16:49,242
Jinda's reputation.

322
00:16:49,563 --> 00:16:50,722
Since you're proposing

323
00:16:50,762 --> 00:16:51,923
to return to the board

324
00:16:52,283 --> 00:16:53,323
and rejoin Jinda,

325
00:16:54,043 --> 00:16:55,323
we have a question for you.

326
00:16:55,642 --> 00:16:56,602
What tangible benefits

327
00:16:56,762 --> 00:16:57,842
can you bring to Jinda?

328
00:16:58,323 --> 00:16:58,842
Exactly.

329
00:16:58,963 --> 00:17:00,482
You can't enter the board

330
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:01,923
(North Waichuan Project No. 1137)
without solid performance.

331
00:17:03,803 --> 00:17:06,242
My plan remains unchanged.

332
00:17:07,482 --> 00:17:08,562
Secure the Diamond Plot

333
00:17:08,802 --> 00:17:09,522
at North Waichuan.

334
00:17:11,123 --> 00:17:12,802
Jinda has already
lost the bidding rights.

335
00:17:13,403 --> 00:17:14,482
The original funds

336
00:17:14,603 --> 00:17:15,923
could be invested in my company,

337
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:16,603
Xinye.

338
00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:18,883
Using Jinda's money

339
00:17:19,242 --> 00:17:20,482
to handle your own affairs?

340
00:17:20,802 --> 00:17:21,322
Well...

341
00:17:23,522 --> 00:17:24,802
When Xinye wins the bid

342
00:17:25,042 --> 00:17:26,322
and secures the plot,

343
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:28,163
we can co-develop it

344
00:17:28,363 --> 00:17:29,322
with Jinda.

345
00:17:31,562 --> 00:17:33,042
We need to review

346
00:17:33,163 --> 00:17:35,082
the bidding proposal
and development strategy.

347
00:17:35,403 --> 00:17:36,562
I've prepared everything.

348
00:17:38,322 --> 00:17:38,883
Take a look.

349
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:40,016
(Project Catalog)

350
00:17:40,923 --> 00:17:42,363
Before our meeting begins,

351
00:17:42,363 --> 00:17:43,883
let's welcome newcomers

352
00:17:43,883 --> 00:17:45,163
to Yan Studio.

353
00:17:47,363 --> 00:17:48,603
Welcome.

354
00:17:49,082 --> 00:17:51,203
The combination of Yan Studio
and botanical dyeing

355
00:17:51,322 --> 00:17:52,123
has increased

356
00:17:52,123 --> 00:17:53,203
tourist numbers

357
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:54,363
in Gubei Town by 32 percent.

358
00:17:59,522 --> 00:18:00,843
Thank you all for your efforts.

359
00:18:02,403 --> 00:18:03,802
I'd also like to announce

360
00:18:04,562 --> 00:18:06,603
that Yan Studio's offline stores

361
00:18:06,643 --> 00:18:08,242
will be opening soon.

362
00:18:08,722 --> 00:18:09,603
I hope

363
00:18:09,603 --> 00:18:10,762
we will not only

364
00:18:11,163 --> 00:18:12,762
promote new Chinese-style clothing

365
00:18:13,322 --> 00:18:14,603
but also

366
00:18:15,522 --> 00:18:17,123
create more job opportunities

367
00:18:17,123 --> 00:18:18,282
through offline expansion.

368
00:18:18,883 --> 00:18:20,042
That's equally crucial.

369
00:18:20,522 --> 00:18:21,843
Now let's have Ms. Qiao explain

370
00:18:21,843 --> 00:18:23,242
our offline expansion strategy.

371
00:18:23,322 --> 00:18:23,802
Alright.

372
00:18:24,482 --> 00:18:25,403
Moving forward,

373
00:18:25,403 --> 00:18:26,603
we'll focus on

374
00:18:26,603 --> 00:18:27,762
our three-year plan.

375
00:18:27,963 --> 00:18:29,643
We plan to open

376
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:31,443
50 physical stores

377
00:18:31,883 --> 00:18:34,082
and estimate that it'll create

378
00:18:34,082 --> 00:18:35,042
over 300 new jobs.

379
00:18:38,802 --> 00:18:40,203
Our marketing department will

380
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:41,963
implement integrated promotions,

381
00:18:41,963 --> 00:18:42,762
online and offline,

382
00:18:42,762 --> 00:18:44,123
to elevate brand visibility.

383
00:18:44,843 --> 00:18:47,203
The summer-fall collection
will start soon.

384
00:18:47,363 --> 00:18:50,363
Let's wait and see.

385
00:18:50,482 --> 00:18:52,522
Come on, folks!

386
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:53,403
I can't wait!

387
00:18:53,403 --> 00:18:53,963
You know what?

388
00:18:53,963 --> 00:18:55,163
I've been working so hard

389
00:18:55,163 --> 00:18:56,322
to walk the runway at home.

390
00:18:56,322 --> 00:18:57,203
Guess what?

391
00:18:57,363 --> 00:18:59,282
Some of our new colleagues

392
00:18:59,282 --> 00:19:00,363
are actually your fans.

393
00:19:00,363 --> 00:19:01,002
You know?

394
00:19:01,002 --> 00:19:01,722
They also want...

395
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:13,242
- Do it! Show us!
- Do it!

396
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:21,328
(Project Description)

397
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:22,192
(Goals & Vision)

398
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:31,088
(Goals & Vision)

399
00:20:03,923 --> 00:20:04,683
What happened?

400
00:20:08,802 --> 00:20:09,963
What did the board say?

401
00:20:12,363 --> 00:20:13,403
Rejected.

402
00:20:16,643 --> 00:20:17,322
Their reason?

403
00:20:19,482 --> 00:20:21,522
They had no issues
with the bidding plan,

404
00:20:22,082 --> 00:20:23,002
but they were

405
00:20:23,242 --> 00:20:24,802
rather dissatisfied with

406
00:20:25,322 --> 00:20:26,363
the development proposal.

407
00:20:27,163 --> 00:20:28,403
They considered it mediocre,

408
00:20:29,242 --> 00:20:31,683
lacking the creative highlight.

409
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,042
If I fail this time,

410
00:20:38,802 --> 00:20:41,002
I only have one last chance.

411
00:20:50,762 --> 00:20:52,883
I know nothing about architecture,

412
00:20:54,722 --> 00:20:55,963
but take, for example,

413
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:56,883
Yan Studio.

414
00:20:59,002 --> 00:21:00,762
When I established Yan Studio,

415
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:03,322
we really struggled

416
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,322
to find our brand identity.

417
00:21:05,963 --> 00:21:07,123
When I first showed

418
00:21:07,123 --> 00:21:07,802
my proposal

419
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:08,963
to Jiang Liang,

420
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:11,923
he completely rejected it.

421
00:21:12,843 --> 00:21:14,643
That's why we changed direction.

422
00:21:15,963 --> 00:21:17,282
I pivoted

423
00:21:17,282 --> 00:21:19,802
from pursuing perfect clothing designs

424
00:21:19,963 --> 00:21:21,963
to creating accessible fashion,

425
00:21:21,963 --> 00:21:24,322
the practical needs in daily life.

426
00:21:24,762 --> 00:21:26,042
It's this very shift

427
00:21:26,683 --> 00:21:27,762
that makes Yan Studio

428
00:21:27,762 --> 00:21:28,643
find something new.

429
00:21:30,282 --> 00:21:30,722
Yan.

430
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,282
Do you remember

431
00:21:32,923 --> 00:21:34,282
you said that local governments

432
00:21:34,403 --> 00:21:36,002
placed great emphasis

433
00:21:36,163 --> 00:21:37,802
on cultural heritage and history?

434
00:21:38,643 --> 00:21:39,322
Sure.

435
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:40,762
So,

436
00:21:44,242 --> 00:21:46,203
could I formally invite you

437
00:21:46,762 --> 00:21:49,522
to become the co-planner

438
00:21:50,002 --> 00:21:51,522
for North Waichuan's development?

439
00:22:00,643 --> 00:22:01,683
Show me your proposal.

440
00:22:05,363 --> 00:22:06,082
Here it is.

441
00:22:11,403 --> 00:22:12,163
Look at this.

442
00:22:12,282 --> 00:22:13,643
But many renowned developers

443
00:22:13,643 --> 00:22:14,482
have shown interest

444
00:22:14,482 --> 00:22:15,363
in this plot.

445
00:22:20,123 --> 00:22:21,363
Thank you all

446
00:22:21,683 --> 00:22:22,482
(North Waichuan Plot 1137)
for coming

447
00:22:22,683 --> 00:22:25,203
to our presentation on Plot 1137.

448
00:22:25,643 --> 00:22:26,123
Mr. Shen.

449
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:28,282
Let's start with the project's features.

450
00:22:28,522 --> 00:22:30,482
Our previous rejection focused

451
00:22:30,603 --> 00:22:32,123
on this critical aspect.

452
00:22:33,242 --> 00:22:35,322
This is the main structure.

453
00:22:35,683 --> 00:22:37,482
The core design element

454
00:22:37,562 --> 00:22:38,923
revolves around the river.

455
00:22:39,363 --> 00:22:41,603
The kinetic water curtain technology

456
00:22:42,082 --> 00:22:44,002
will amplify the light-shadow effects

457
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:45,002
very dramatically.

458
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:46,923
Impressive.

459
00:22:47,403 --> 00:22:48,282
It's essentially

460
00:22:48,603 --> 00:22:49,843
an exquisite art piece.

461
00:22:50,683 --> 00:22:51,242
Mr. Shen.

462
00:22:51,363 --> 00:22:52,562
While we appreciate

463
00:22:52,683 --> 00:22:53,883
the main building's design,

464
00:22:54,163 --> 00:22:55,562
how can you guarantee

465
00:22:55,603 --> 00:22:57,203
Plot 1137 will

466
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:59,322
become a first-tier development?

467
00:22:59,643 --> 00:23:01,762
Regarding cultural positioning,

468
00:23:02,603 --> 00:23:05,082
let's welcome Xu Yan,

469
00:23:05,683 --> 00:23:06,963
my special art director,

470
00:23:07,082 --> 00:23:07,923
the founder

471
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:09,363
of the renowned Yan Studio,

472
00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:11,002
a Chinese-style brand,

473
00:23:11,443 --> 00:23:12,322
to present her vision.

474
00:23:13,443 --> 00:23:14,443
Hello, everyone.

475
00:23:14,443 --> 00:23:15,123
I'm Xu Yan.

476
00:23:15,643 --> 00:23:17,443
About the interior

477
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,603
of Plot 1137,

478
00:23:18,722 --> 00:23:19,683
our preliminary plan

479
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:20,643
is to increase its value

480
00:23:20,722 --> 00:23:23,042
through cultural events

481
00:23:23,203 --> 00:23:25,603
and art exhibitions.

482
00:23:26,643 --> 00:23:28,363
Traditional commercial complexes

483
00:23:28,522 --> 00:23:29,562
typically relied on

484
00:23:29,562 --> 00:23:30,443
international brands

485
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:32,482
for core value demonstration.

486
00:23:32,722 --> 00:23:34,203
However, consumers have shown

487
00:23:34,203 --> 00:23:34,883
growing interest

488
00:23:34,883 --> 00:23:36,242
in Chinese cultural stuff

489
00:23:36,322 --> 00:23:37,443
and spent on it.

490
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,443
So this reflects

491
00:23:39,603 --> 00:23:41,522
the resurgence of Chinese culture

492
00:23:41,802 --> 00:23:43,522
and the boost of national pride

493
00:23:43,562 --> 00:23:45,683
and cultural confidence.

494
00:23:46,203 --> 00:23:47,322
Over the past three years,

495
00:23:47,363 --> 00:23:49,203
(Art-Commercial Complexes)
the intangible cultural heritage market

496
00:23:49,203 --> 00:23:50,802
has grown annually by over 40 percent,

497
00:23:50,802 --> 00:23:51,722
reaching a scale

498
00:23:51,722 --> 00:23:52,603
of 150 billion yuan

499
00:23:52,603 --> 00:23:53,843
of market value.

500
00:23:54,242 --> 00:23:54,883
Last year,

501
00:23:54,963 --> 00:23:56,562
Chinese-style apparel sales

502
00:23:56,562 --> 00:23:58,322
surged 43 percent,

503
00:23:58,482 --> 00:24:01,322
while intangible heritage crafts sales
grew 60 percent.

504
00:24:01,843 --> 00:24:03,322
Elaborate on your strategy.

505
00:24:04,282 --> 00:24:06,163
Our core strategy involves

506
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:09,562
introducing Chinese
intangible heritage brands.

507
00:24:09,762 --> 00:24:10,843
We've made three phases.

508
00:24:11,963 --> 00:24:12,963
Phase one

509
00:24:12,963 --> 00:24:13,963
focuses on

510
00:24:14,002 --> 00:24:15,722
traditional textile crafts,

511
00:24:15,923 --> 00:24:18,163
such as Su embroidery,

512
00:24:18,282 --> 00:24:21,042
Yunjin brocade of Nanjing,

513
00:24:21,123 --> 00:24:22,883
and Hunan embroidery.

514
00:24:23,603 --> 00:24:24,603
Phase two

515
00:24:24,683 --> 00:24:25,722
focuses on

516
00:24:25,722 --> 00:24:26,923
traditional craft brands,

517
00:24:27,163 --> 00:24:27,883
such as

518
00:24:27,963 --> 00:24:29,923
Yixing Zisha clay,

519
00:24:29,963 --> 00:24:31,203
Longquan celadon,

520
00:24:31,322 --> 00:24:32,522
and Henan Ru porcelain.

521
00:24:32,883 --> 00:24:33,802
Phase three

522
00:24:33,883 --> 00:24:35,322
focuses on jewelry

523
00:24:35,322 --> 00:24:36,883
and art brands,

524
00:24:37,522 --> 00:24:38,883
such as filigree enamel,

525
00:24:39,082 --> 00:24:40,082
(Jewelry and Art Brands)
filigree and inlay,

526
00:24:40,242 --> 00:24:41,082
and cloisonne.

527
00:24:41,403 --> 00:24:42,363
These kinds of brands

528
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:43,843
all serve our purpose

529
00:24:44,042 --> 00:24:46,123
to create an intangible heritage zone.

530
00:24:48,522 --> 00:24:50,322
The mission of our entire project

531
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:52,562
is to establish

532
00:24:52,562 --> 00:24:55,082
an economically sustainable community.

533
00:24:56,082 --> 00:24:58,722
We want these artisans

534
00:24:58,722 --> 00:24:59,843
to have

535
00:25:00,242 --> 00:25:01,082
a stable means

536
00:25:01,163 --> 00:25:03,403
of sustainable support.

537
00:25:03,843 --> 00:25:05,042
Moreover, we hope

538
00:25:05,522 --> 00:25:06,643
this area

539
00:25:06,843 --> 00:25:08,242
won't just be

540
00:25:08,643 --> 00:25:10,282
for a temporary festival event

541
00:25:10,322 --> 00:25:11,843
or a one-time exhibition.

542
00:25:12,282 --> 00:25:13,683
Instead, we want people

543
00:25:13,923 --> 00:25:15,123
to live here

544
00:25:15,522 --> 00:25:16,562
and work here.

545
00:25:17,042 --> 00:25:18,363
So, they can

546
00:25:18,522 --> 00:25:20,722
feel a true sense of belonging.

547
00:25:21,802 --> 00:25:24,203
Regarding Jinda's investment risks,
how to mitigate them?

548
00:25:25,082 --> 00:25:26,683
My family's money

549
00:25:27,522 --> 00:25:28,802
will serve as junior capital,

550
00:25:29,603 --> 00:25:30,923
while Jinda's investment funds

551
00:25:31,443 --> 00:25:32,643
will be senior capital.

552
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:35,762
You'll have priority

553
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:36,843
in receiving returns

554
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:38,403
but bear risks last.

555
00:25:39,282 --> 00:25:40,522
My goal is to minimize

556
00:25:40,522 --> 00:25:41,363
Jinda's risks

557
00:25:41,482 --> 00:25:42,282
as much as possible.

558
00:25:51,242 --> 00:25:52,443
After two and a half hours

559
00:25:52,443 --> 00:25:53,802
(One month later)
and 186 rounds of bidding,

560
00:25:53,923 --> 00:25:55,203
Xinye won the bid

561
00:25:55,203 --> 00:25:56,562
at 3.806 billion yuan

562
00:25:56,562 --> 00:25:58,242
for the North Waichuan plot.

563
00:25:58,603 --> 00:25:59,322
The premium rate

564
00:25:59,322 --> 00:26:00,603
reached 27.4 percent.

565
00:26:02,363 --> 00:26:02,923
Mr. Shen.

566
00:26:02,963 --> 00:26:04,163
What are your plans for

567
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:05,082
Xinye's future?

568
00:26:06,002 --> 00:26:06,643
Well then,

569
00:26:06,683 --> 00:26:08,042
today marks a milestone

570
00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:09,443
for Xinye.

571
00:26:09,683 --> 00:26:10,562
I hope you will

572
00:26:10,562 --> 00:26:11,562
continue supporting us.

573
00:26:11,883 --> 00:26:12,562
Thank you.

574
00:26:12,883 --> 00:26:13,883
Today's meeting

575
00:26:14,002 --> 00:26:14,883
is significant.

576
00:26:15,322 --> 00:26:16,002
First,

577
00:26:16,482 --> 00:26:18,482
we'll withdraw the compensation lawsuit

578
00:26:18,762 --> 00:26:20,923
against Shen Jinsong and Shen Haoming

579
00:26:21,482 --> 00:26:23,322
and reinstate their positions.

580
00:26:23,562 --> 00:26:24,242
Next,

581
00:26:24,363 --> 00:26:25,843
we need to revisit

582
00:26:25,883 --> 00:26:27,282
the new personnel appointments.

583
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:30,322
Currently, Jinda and Xinye

584
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:33,163
have successfully
signed the acquisition agreement

585
00:26:33,683 --> 00:26:34,722
to jointly develop

586
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:37,242
Plot 1137 in North Waichuan.

587
00:26:37,883 --> 00:26:39,802
Haoming played a crucial role

588
00:26:39,802 --> 00:26:41,203
in facilitating this collaboration.

589
00:26:41,482 --> 00:26:42,722
He has demonstrated

590
00:26:42,923 --> 00:26:44,242
exceptional management skills

591
00:26:44,242 --> 00:26:45,203
in project operations.

592
00:26:45,482 --> 00:26:47,363
We will aim to

593
00:26:47,683 --> 00:26:49,363
assemble a strong leadership team

594
00:26:49,722 --> 00:26:52,683
to oversee the entire project.

595
00:26:53,042 --> 00:26:54,403
After careful consideration,

596
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:56,123
I propose

597
00:26:56,883 --> 00:26:59,562
that Haoming formally join the board

598
00:26:59,843 --> 00:27:02,683
and be promoted
to President of Jinda Group.

599
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:04,562
Please raise your hand if you agree.

600
00:27:21,843 --> 00:27:22,403
Good.

601
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:23,643
Unanimously approved.

602
00:27:24,002 --> 00:27:25,123
Congratulations, Haoming.

603
00:27:26,403 --> 00:27:27,683
Thank you all

604
00:27:28,242 --> 00:27:30,042
for your support and trust.

605
00:27:30,643 --> 00:27:31,363
Thank you all.

606
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:32,443
Haoming.

607
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:40,082
I hope you'll lead everyone

608
00:27:40,603 --> 00:27:41,562
and Jinda

609
00:27:42,403 --> 00:27:43,403
to a better future.

610
00:27:44,603 --> 00:27:45,242
Chairman,

611
00:27:46,002 --> 00:27:47,562
I'll spare no effort

612
00:27:48,242 --> 00:27:49,403
to live up to expectations

613
00:27:50,082 --> 00:27:51,242
from you all

614
00:27:51,363 --> 00:27:52,242
and Jinda.

615
00:28:18,683 --> 00:28:20,123
Add more filling!

616
00:28:21,082 --> 00:28:21,722
Grandma.

617
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:26,443
Obviously, I made this one.

618
00:28:26,482 --> 00:28:27,963
And you made this one.

619
00:28:28,322 --> 00:28:29,883
Why does mine look like this?

620
00:28:30,762 --> 00:28:31,403
Yan.

621
00:28:31,522 --> 00:28:32,843
No matter how you make them,

622
00:28:33,082 --> 00:28:34,363
I'll always love those you make.

623
00:28:34,722 --> 00:28:35,643
I think

624
00:28:35,643 --> 00:28:36,883
Haoming will love them too.

625
00:28:37,522 --> 00:28:38,082
Definitely.

626
00:28:38,403 --> 00:28:39,242
For sure.

627
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:41,603
Grandma, look!

628
00:28:41,843 --> 00:28:43,002
How's my dumpling wrapper?

629
00:28:44,042 --> 00:28:45,123
Not bad.

630
00:28:45,562 --> 00:28:47,363
You've improved so much.

631
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:48,883
Haoming.

632
00:28:49,163 --> 00:28:50,482
Making dumplings

633
00:28:51,082 --> 00:28:52,562
is making wishes.

634
00:28:53,002 --> 00:28:53,843
Each dumpling

635
00:28:54,082 --> 00:28:55,482
is a blessing.

636
00:28:56,883 --> 00:28:59,242
You're rolling wrappers
bringing good luck.

637
00:28:59,802 --> 00:29:00,883
You're wrapping dumplings

638
00:29:00,923 --> 00:29:01,683
carrying wellness.

639
00:29:01,843 --> 00:29:02,963
And I am

640
00:29:03,762 --> 00:29:06,242
wrapping happiness.

641
00:29:08,683 --> 00:29:10,123
There's some insight.

642
00:29:10,443 --> 00:29:11,443
Did you read that online?

643
00:29:11,963 --> 00:29:12,923
Stayed up late again?

644
00:29:12,963 --> 00:29:14,443
No, I didn't.

645
00:29:15,242 --> 00:29:17,762
Look at these plump dumplings.

646
00:29:18,002 --> 00:29:19,403
They make me so happy.

647
00:29:21,482 --> 00:29:22,082
Plus,

648
00:29:22,363 --> 00:29:23,603
we are

649
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:25,282
making beef dumplings.

650
00:29:25,843 --> 00:29:27,762
That means good luck!

651
00:29:27,802 --> 00:29:28,843
A family

652
00:29:28,843 --> 00:29:29,802
gathers like this

653
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:31,403
to make dumplings,

654
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:32,722
which means we will

655
00:29:32,762 --> 00:29:35,322
always live a happy and lucky life.

656
00:29:37,883 --> 00:29:38,403
Grandma.

657
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:40,963
Look,

658
00:29:41,203 --> 00:29:42,603
if you live here,

659
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:44,562
Haoming and I can eat dumplings

660
00:29:44,562 --> 00:29:45,923
every week.

661
00:29:46,843 --> 00:29:48,242
But if you leave,

662
00:29:48,522 --> 00:29:49,762
who will make dumplings for us?

663
00:29:50,762 --> 00:29:51,843
Why don't you just

664
00:29:52,643 --> 00:29:53,282
stay here?

665
00:29:54,322 --> 00:29:55,443
I've been here

666
00:29:55,482 --> 00:29:56,963
for a while now.

667
00:29:57,522 --> 00:29:58,443
But I have

668
00:29:58,443 --> 00:30:00,522
missed my garden plants

669
00:30:00,762 --> 00:30:02,562
and my little chickens and ducks.

670
00:30:03,123 --> 00:30:04,403
I had neighbors

671
00:30:04,963 --> 00:30:06,443
taking care of them.

672
00:30:06,843 --> 00:30:08,123
Your place is wonderful,

673
00:30:08,683 --> 00:30:09,762
really lovely.

674
00:30:10,883 --> 00:30:12,482
I'm happy to live here.

675
00:30:12,963 --> 00:30:14,482
But I still

676
00:30:14,963 --> 00:30:16,322
miss my own home.

677
00:30:17,443 --> 00:30:18,082
Well,

678
00:30:18,123 --> 00:30:19,282
I just want you both

679
00:30:20,123 --> 00:30:21,522
to stay happy.

680
00:30:22,082 --> 00:30:23,363
That's all I hope for.

681
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:31,042
Wipe off the flour.

682
00:30:31,042 --> 00:30:31,762
What's he doing?

683
00:30:31,762 --> 00:30:32,163
Photos.

684
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,603
Today's reunion dinner

685
00:30:33,923 --> 00:30:34,843
deserves a photo.

686
00:30:37,363 --> 00:30:38,562
With the dumplings?

687
00:30:38,643 --> 00:30:39,482
Sure.

688
00:30:40,082 --> 00:30:40,963
Let's take a selfie.

689
00:30:41,163 --> 00:30:42,002
Like this?

690
00:30:42,322 --> 00:30:42,963
Well...

691
00:30:42,963 --> 00:30:43,482
Is it okay?

692
00:30:43,603 --> 00:30:44,403
How should I pose?

693
00:30:44,482 --> 00:30:45,403
Just look here.

694
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:46,163
Dumplings.

695
00:30:46,163 --> 00:30:47,683

- Warm it.
- Rub our hands.

724
00:31:34,722 --> 00:31:35,562
Okay.

725
00:31:35,562 --> 00:31:36,762
Time for the magic show.

726
00:31:37,042 --> 00:31:37,363

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

733
00:31:43,643 --> 00:31:44,656
It better not disappear.
