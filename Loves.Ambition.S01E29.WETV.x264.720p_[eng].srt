Mr. Shen, your guest is here.

29
00:01:50,554 --> 00:01:51,194
Haoming.

30
00:01:51,754 --> 00:01:52,474
Mr. Qu.

31
00:01:55,034 --> 00:01:55,953
Long time no see.

32
00:01:56,474 --> 00:01:57,953
Come, give me a hug.

33
00:01:58,754 --> 00:01:59,674
You're still the same.

34
00:02:00,034 --> 00:02:01,114
Not really.

35
00:02:01,313 --> 00:02:03,353
But you are more handsome.

36
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:05,394
Why didn't you tell me earlier

37
00:02:05,394 --> 00:02:06,274
that you came to me?

38
00:02:06,274 --> 00:02:07,554
Chen Lin could've picked you up.

39
00:02:08,354 --> 00:02:10,074
The driver can also bring me here.

40
00:02:11,354 --> 00:02:12,473
Alright, please have a seat.

41
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:15,633
Your office is quite spacious

42
00:02:15,954 --> 00:02:16,674
and splendid.

43
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:19,234
Jinda is indeed splendid.

44
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:20,713
Have you

45
00:02:20,753 --> 00:02:21,354
met my dad?

46
00:02:21,473 --> 00:02:23,193
I visited your dad long ago.

47
00:02:23,873 --> 00:02:25,153
He invited me

48
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:26,234
to a meeting,

49
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,313
but I wasn't interested,

50
00:02:27,674 --> 00:02:29,153
so I came to you right away.

51
00:02:30,753 --> 00:02:31,633
Glad to see you.

52
00:02:36,153 --> 00:02:37,713
Dahongpao Tea from Mount Wuyi.

53
00:02:37,913 --> 00:02:39,633
Haoming,

54
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:41,074
it's been years,

55
00:02:41,074 --> 00:02:42,633
yet you still remember my preference.

56
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:44,873
I remember

57
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:47,234
when my dad took me
to Guangdong as a child,

58
00:02:47,674 --> 00:02:49,554
you were the one who took me

59
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:50,713
to tea houses

60
00:02:51,274 --> 00:02:52,354
to drink Dahongpao Tea.

61
00:02:58,114 --> 00:02:58,633
How is it?

62
00:02:58,834 --> 00:02:59,313
Excellent!

63
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:01,794
Haoming,

64
00:03:03,674 --> 00:03:04,674
I have

65
00:03:04,794 --> 00:03:05,713
devoted most of my life

66
00:03:06,193 --> 00:03:07,274
to Jinda.

67
00:03:08,794 --> 00:03:09,873
To be honest,

68
00:03:11,394 --> 00:03:13,394
I haven't managed my family well.

69
00:03:13,954 --> 00:03:15,753
And I'm still a bachelor.

70
00:03:16,234 --> 00:03:17,234
I've

71
00:03:17,753 --> 00:03:19,074
watched you grow up.

72
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,753
In my eyes,

73
00:03:22,753 --> 00:03:24,114
you're like my own son.

74
00:03:24,753 --> 00:03:25,313
Mr. Qu.

75
00:03:25,674 --> 00:03:27,193
You are my dad's best friend.

76
00:03:28,234 --> 00:03:29,713
Your dedication to Jinda

77
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:31,193
has been witnessed by all.

78
00:03:31,593 --> 00:03:32,674
Without your efforts

79
00:03:32,794 --> 00:03:34,354
in the Greater Bay Area,

80
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:36,313
we wouldn't have achieved that much.

81
00:03:36,794 --> 00:03:37,794
As a junior,

82
00:03:38,153 --> 00:03:39,234
I must learn from you.

83
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:40,994
I just did what's right.

84
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:43,234
Haoming.

85
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:44,794
This time, I came

86
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,633
for one purpose only.

87
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,153
I heard you joined the board,

88
00:03:49,394 --> 00:03:51,313
so I came specially to vote for you.

89
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:52,954
All these years,

90
00:03:53,554 --> 00:03:54,913
I've always supported your dad.

91
00:03:56,074 --> 00:03:57,074
Now, of course,

92
00:03:57,313 --> 00:03:58,633
I offer you my support.

93
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:00,954
Don't feel burdened.

94
00:04:01,473 --> 00:04:02,433
Just do what you want.

95
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:04,354
Thank you, Mr. Qu.

96
00:04:07,674 --> 00:04:08,433
Here. Haoming.

97
00:04:09,593 --> 00:04:10,274
Let's toast.

98
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,913
How's it going?

99
00:04:17,594 --> 00:04:18,714
We've been acquiring

100
00:04:18,714 --> 00:04:20,193
stocks from Jinda's retail investors.

101
00:04:21,193 --> 00:04:22,354
But we still don't

102
00:04:22,354 --> 00:04:23,193
have enough stocks.

103
00:04:24,114 --> 00:04:25,234
Several major shareholders

104
00:04:25,234 --> 00:04:27,474
are reluctant to sell.
I'll figure it out.

105
00:04:29,313 --> 00:04:31,034
If you can uncover that child's

106
00:04:31,034 --> 00:04:32,953
connection to Shen Haoming,

107
00:04:33,594 --> 00:04:34,433
then things

108
00:04:34,554 --> 00:04:35,633
will be much easier.

109
00:04:35,914 --> 00:04:37,193
Weiping and I are working on it.

110
00:04:38,234 --> 00:04:39,393
I need results.

111
00:04:40,554 --> 00:04:41,313
Understood, Mr. Qu.

112
00:04:42,154 --> 00:04:43,234
My people have found out

113
00:04:43,914 --> 00:04:44,794
that Shen Haoming

114
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:46,674
and Fang Yu did have a child

115
00:04:46,674 --> 00:04:47,714
while studying abroad.

116
00:04:48,474 --> 00:04:50,513
During Fang Yu's pregnancy,
Haoming stayed with her.

117
00:04:52,633 --> 00:04:54,474
But after returning from abroad,

118
00:04:54,474 --> 00:04:55,114
Shen Haoming

119
00:04:55,114 --> 00:04:56,273
remained single.

120
00:04:56,873 --> 00:04:57,873
Where was the child?

121
00:04:58,034 --> 00:05:00,234
Not long after Shen Haoming's returning,

122
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:01,513
Shen Jinsong and Yu Lan

123
00:05:01,914 --> 00:05:03,794
publicly announced they had given birth

124
00:05:03,794 --> 00:05:04,914
to a second child overseas.

125
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:07,914
Guess who

126
00:05:08,354 --> 00:05:10,313
the biological father
of this child actually is.

127
00:05:10,554 --> 00:05:12,034
Maybe Shen Haochen isn't

128
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,234
Shen Haoming's

129
00:05:14,234 --> 00:05:15,234
younger brother,

130
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:17,393
but his son, right?

131
00:05:18,073 --> 00:05:20,114
If this gets exposed...

132
00:05:31,594 --> 00:05:32,154
Chen Lin,

133
00:05:34,354 --> 00:05:35,393
I never thought Mr. Shen's

134
00:05:35,393 --> 00:05:36,393
entry into the board

135
00:05:36,393 --> 00:05:37,513
would go so smoothly.

136
00:05:38,114 --> 00:05:38,953
Of course.

137
00:05:39,154 --> 00:05:40,273
Mr. Shen

138
00:05:40,474 --> 00:05:41,513
truly deserves it.

139
00:05:42,114 --> 00:05:42,674
Thanks.

140
00:05:44,234 --> 00:05:44,794
Now,

141
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:46,154
all these board members

142
00:05:46,193 --> 00:05:47,154
invite him to dinners.

143
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:48,594
We have to accompany him

144
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:49,714
in tonight's dinner.

145
00:05:53,474 --> 00:05:54,714
Why did you sigh?

146
00:05:56,994 --> 00:05:58,433
I need to drive Mr. Shen home.

147
00:06:00,114 --> 00:06:01,474
Today is my girlfriend's birthday.

148
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,114
She has warned me

149
00:06:03,554 --> 00:06:06,313
that if I don't show up,
I'll be off her list.

150
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,753
You have to choose
between career and love.

151
00:06:12,994 --> 00:06:14,393
I am so worried.

152
00:06:15,753 --> 00:06:16,273
Don't worry.

153
00:06:16,914 --> 00:06:17,994
As you are in dilemma,

154
00:06:18,953 --> 00:06:19,914
after tonight's dinner,

155
00:06:20,273 --> 00:06:21,433
I'll drive Mr. Shen home.

156
00:06:22,594 --> 00:06:23,914
But your hand is injured.

157
00:06:24,994 --> 00:06:26,234
Minor injury. No problem.

158
00:06:26,873 --> 00:06:27,794
Leave it to me.

159
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:28,354
Don't worry.

160
00:06:28,794 --> 00:06:29,354
Seriously?

161
00:06:30,034 --> 00:06:31,154
I'll arrange a driver

162
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:31,994
to send you both.

163
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:32,714
I'll go

164
00:06:32,714 --> 00:06:33,633
to request leave now.

165
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:35,873
Thanks.

166
00:06:35,994 --> 00:06:37,873
You help me a lot.
I'll treat you to a meal.

167
00:06:49,753 --> 00:06:50,833
Mr. Shen, here.

168
00:06:55,554 --> 00:06:56,073
You're home.

169
00:06:56,714 --> 00:06:57,193
Here.

170
00:06:58,154 --> 00:06:58,794
Thanks.

171
00:07:01,114 --> 00:07:02,073
I'll help you up.

172
00:07:03,193 --> 00:07:04,433
You don't need to come up.

173
00:07:04,594 --> 00:07:05,154
Are you okay?

174
00:07:05,674 --> 00:07:06,234
Sure.

175
00:07:07,234 --> 00:07:08,034
Be careful.

176
00:07:09,114 --> 00:07:09,873
I'm leaving.

177
00:07:11,313 --> 00:07:11,753
Okay.

178
00:08:02,554 --> 00:08:03,753
Shen Haoming's child

179
00:08:03,994 --> 00:08:05,753
had a paternity test in London.

180
00:08:07,273 --> 00:08:08,474

181
00:08:22,554 --> 00:08:23,474

00:17:49,553 --> 00:17:50,954
Where's my mom?

388
00:17:51,194 --> 00:17:52,513
Who is she really?

389
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:55,273
Why did you lie?

390
00:17:56,113 --> 00:17:56,994
Do you never

391
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:58,593
want me at all?

392
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:08,394
I understand you have

393
00:18:08,434 --> 00:18:09,434
questions right now.

394
00:18:10,634 --> 00:18:11,434
Go home first.

395
00:18:13,194 --> 00:18:14,154
We'll talk later.

396
00:18:22,273 --> 00:18:22,833
Chen Lin,

397
00:18:23,914 --> 00:18:24,994
drive Haochen home.

398
00:18:25,474 --> 00:18:26,474
Yes, Mr. Shen.

399
00:18:26,954 --> 00:18:27,914
The board wants you

400
00:18:27,914 --> 00:18:29,394
to return to the meeting right away.

401
00:18:29,753 --> 00:18:30,313
Besides,

402
00:18:30,634 --> 00:18:31,434
many reporters

403
00:18:31,474 --> 00:18:32,194
are in the lobby.

404
00:18:32,474 --> 00:18:34,234
Bring my car to the underground garage.

405
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,154
Don't let any reporter

406
00:18:36,154 --> 00:18:36,914
approach Haochen.

407
00:18:37,434 --> 00:18:37,914
Got it.

408
00:19:43,513 --> 00:19:44,553
Don't overthink.

409
00:19:45,553 --> 00:19:47,073
Ignore the online news.

410
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:49,394
Wait for me.

411
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:19,033
The Chairman's family matters

412
00:20:19,994 --> 00:20:21,753
shouldn't concern us,

413
00:20:22,073 --> 00:20:23,234
but you father and son

414
00:20:23,914 --> 00:20:25,793
are our core leadership.

415
00:20:26,874 --> 00:20:28,194
Your every action

416
00:20:29,273 --> 00:20:31,434
reflects the image,

417
00:20:31,434 --> 00:20:35,353
reputation, and integrity of the group.

418
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:37,954
Jinsong,

419
00:20:39,033 --> 00:20:40,073
any solutions?

420
00:20:40,793 --> 00:20:41,634
Just tell us

421
00:20:42,914 --> 00:20:45,113
and be honest to us.

422
00:20:45,753 --> 00:20:47,033
Let us know clearly.

423
00:20:48,273 --> 00:20:49,674
Don't drag this on.

424
00:20:50,113 --> 00:20:50,474
Exactly.

425
00:20:50,634 --> 00:20:51,634
We must

426
00:20:51,674 --> 00:20:53,874
address this problem.

427
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:57,353
You've caused us pressure
while tricking customers.

428
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:58,194
Exactly.

429
00:20:58,553 --> 00:20:59,313
Your silence

430
00:20:59,394 --> 00:21:01,234
leaves us unable to explain anything.

431
00:21:01,714 --> 00:21:03,194
You must explain to us.

432
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:05,073
Haoming.

433
00:21:08,073 --> 00:21:08,793
Haoming.

434
00:21:16,874 --> 00:21:18,553
Dad, are you feeling unwell?

435
00:21:21,234 --> 00:21:22,194
The Chairman isn't well.

436
00:21:22,313 --> 00:21:23,273
Let's end it for now.

437
00:21:28,113 --> 00:21:29,154
Listen to me.

438
00:21:30,714 --> 00:21:32,073
The Chairman isn't feeling well.

439
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:33,353
No matter what,

440
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,033
we shouldn't pressure him.

441
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:36,994
Anyway,

442
00:21:37,994 --> 00:21:39,353
this situation can't get worse.

443
00:21:39,753 --> 00:21:40,833
Let's wait and see.

444
00:21:41,674 --> 00:21:42,994
Let's see how long

445
00:21:44,113 --> 00:21:45,353
he can stall.

446
00:21:53,113 --> 00:21:54,874
Dad. Take the medicine.

447
00:21:57,954 --> 00:21:58,513
Put it there.

448
00:22:13,553 --> 00:22:14,674
Chairman, Mr. Shen.

449
00:22:16,954 --> 00:22:17,553
What's wrong?

450
00:22:17,954 --> 00:22:18,753
Several companies

451
00:22:18,753 --> 00:22:19,553
are acquiring

452
00:22:19,553 --> 00:22:20,553
large quantities

453
00:22:20,553 --> 00:22:21,313
of Jinda's stocks.

454
00:22:21,954 --> 00:22:23,793
The main buyer is Situo Construction.

455
00:22:25,113 --> 00:22:25,833
It is the one

456
00:22:25,994 --> 00:22:26,914
that competed with us

457
00:22:26,914 --> 00:22:28,434
for the Baraikin project.

458
00:22:29,073 --> 00:22:29,874
How many stocks?

459
00:22:30,273 --> 00:22:31,194
3.7 percent of stocks,

460
00:22:31,234 --> 00:22:32,234
and it's increasing.

461
00:22:38,714 --> 00:22:39,313
Haoming.

462
00:22:40,513 --> 00:22:42,714
Initiate buybacks immediately.

463
00:22:43,033 --> 00:22:44,273
This shows market

464
00:22:44,273 --> 00:22:45,793
our confidence.

465
00:23:10,994 --> 00:23:11,833
Shen Haochen!

466
00:23:13,674 --> 00:23:14,434
Haochen!

467
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,752
(Secretary Chen)

468
00:23:21,313 --> 00:23:21,714
Hello.

469
00:23:21,874 --> 00:23:22,593
Mr. Shen,

470
00:23:22,994 --> 00:23:24,474
Haochen opened the car door

471
00:23:24,634 --> 00:23:25,954
during a red light and ran off.

472
00:23:26,714 --> 00:23:27,833
He disappeared

473
00:23:28,513 --> 00:23:29,674
before I could catch up.

474
00:23:50,113 --> 00:23:50,674
Haochen.

475
00:23:51,674 --> 00:23:52,553
Why are you here?

476
00:23:53,593 --> 00:23:54,353
Mr. Han.

477
00:23:55,674 --> 00:23:56,954
I know what happened today.

478
00:23:58,394 --> 00:23:59,313
You must feel

479
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:00,313
terrible now.

480
00:24:01,553 --> 00:24:02,793
Come on, I'll take you home.

481
00:24:04,154 --> 00:24:04,833
No.

482
00:24:05,954 --> 00:24:07,553
Do you want to know who your mom is?

483
00:24:10,674 --> 00:24:11,194
Yes!

484
00:24:11,593 --> 00:24:12,714
I'll take you to see her.

485
00:24:34,234 --> 00:24:34,674
We're here.

486
00:24:40,073 --> 00:24:40,874
Didn't you say

487
00:24:40,874 --> 00:24:41,994
to see my mom?

488
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:43,273
Why bring me here?

489
00:24:43,674 --> 00:24:45,033
To protect your mom's identity

490
00:24:45,033 --> 00:24:46,033
from revealing.

491
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:49,273
I got it.

492
00:24:49,874 --> 00:24:50,434
Now,

493
00:24:51,113 --> 00:24:51,793
I'll take you in

494
00:24:51,793 --> 00:24:52,674
and get some rest.

495
00:24:52,914 --> 00:24:53,674
Wait for me there.

496
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:54,674
Don't run around.

497
00:24:55,033 --> 00:24:55,914
I'll fetch your mom.

498
00:24:56,994 --> 00:24:57,513
Okay?

499
00:24:58,394 --> 00:24:58,793
Okay.

500
00:25:04,634 --> 00:25:05,634
What did the police say?

501
00:25:06,753 --> 00:25:08,434
They've filed a report.

502
00:25:08,793 --> 00:25:11,593
They are checking surveillance footage,
and dispatching officers

503
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,714
to Haochen's usual spots

504
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:13,634
to search for him.

505
00:25:14,874 --> 00:25:16,753
Yan has already gone

506
00:25:16,874 --> 00:25:18,194
to check Haochen's usual spots.

507
00:25:18,353 --> 00:25:19,874
If Yan finds him, she will tell me.

508
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:21,194
Haoming.

509
00:25:21,194 --> 00:25:21,753
Don't worry.

510
00:25:23,553 --> 00:25:24,194
How is Dad?

511
00:25:25,073 --> 00:25:27,033
I didn't tell him
about Haochen's situation.

512
00:25:28,073 --> 00:25:29,874
I let him rest upstairs for a while.

513
00:25:30,273 --> 00:25:31,194
I'll tell him

514
00:25:31,194 --> 00:25:32,154
when possible.

515
00:25:32,474 --> 00:25:32,914
Okay.

516
00:25:34,434 --> 00:25:34,954
Mom.

517
00:25:35,553 --> 00:25:36,914
Haochen will definitely be fine.

518
00:25:37,313 --> 00:25:38,194
Don't worry.

519
00:25:39,194 --> 00:25:39,874
Many reporters

520
00:25:39,874 --> 00:25:40,753
are out there.

521
00:25:41,434 --> 00:25:44,313
You should stay here

522
00:25:44,434 --> 00:25:45,313
for now.

523
00:25:46,154 --> 00:25:46,553
Alright.

524
00:25:47,033 --> 00:25:47,994
I need to go out

525
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:49,194
to look for Haochen.

526
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,394
Haoming.

527
00:26:04,353 --> 00:26:05,434
Haochen's backpack!

528
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:11,632
(Yongxiang)

529
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,313
Yongxiang Building?

530
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:23,793
Officer Liu.

531
00:26:24,434 --> 00:26:25,874
I just received a photo.

532
00:26:26,394 --> 00:26:27,513
It's Haochen's backpack.

533
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:29,874
Location is Yongxiang Building.

534
00:26:30,273 --> 00:26:30,874
Please

535
00:26:31,273 --> 00:26:32,353
dispatch officers.

536
00:26:33,113 --> 00:26:33,753
Thank you.

537
00:26:38,273 --> 00:26:38,833
Yan.

538
00:26:39,313 --> 00:26:39,954
Where are you?

539
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:14,674
Han Weiping?

540
00:27:20,434 --> 00:27:21,313
Wait for the police.

541
00:27:46,194 --> 00:27:46,914
Where is Haochen?

542
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:49,474
Mr. Shen.

543
00:27:50,313 --> 00:27:51,394
What are you doing?

544
00:27:52,634 --> 00:27:53,994
I didn't harm Haochen.

545
00:27:54,194 --> 00:27:55,714
You are the ones who harmed him.

546
00:27:56,154 --> 00:27:56,914
He wants to know

547
00:27:56,954 --> 00:27:57,874
who his mom is.

548
00:27:57,954 --> 00:27:58,793
Is he wrong?

549
00:27:59,194 --> 00:28:00,994
You're the ones who kept lying to him.

550
00:28:00,994 --> 00:28:01,793
Not me.

551
00:28:02,033 --> 00:28:03,273
Where is Haochen?

552
00:28:04,914 --> 00:28:07,234
The innermost room on the second floor.

553
00:28:22,113 --> 00:28:22,674
Haochen!

554
00:28:24,914 --> 00:28:25,434
Haoming!

555
00:28:31,273 --> 00:28:31,914
Are you okay?

556
00:28:38,154 --> 00:28:38,914
Thank you.

557
00:28:38,914 --> 00:28:40,353
It's okay. We're just doing our job.

558
00:28:40,513 --> 00:28:41,154
He is fine.

559
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:42,914
Please help us

560
00:28:42,994 --> 00:28:44,313
with a statement later.

561
00:28:45,073 --> 00:28:45,634
No problem.

562
00:28:45,634 --> 00:28:46,394
Thank you.

563
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:49,234
Be careful.

564
00:28:49,753 --> 00:28:50,273
I'm fine.

565
00:28:55,394 --> 00:28:57,313
They're coming out!

566
00:28:58,073 --> 00:28:59,593
We're on official duty.

567
00:28:59,593 --> 00:29:00,113
Step back!

568
00:29:03,593 --> 00:29:04,033
Haoming.

569
00:29:05,434 --> 00:29:07,234
It's okay. Stay behind me.

570
00:29:07,714 --> 00:29:08,874
- Mr. Shen!
- Mr. Shen!

571
00:29:08,994 --> 00:29:10,033
Make way, please!

572
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:10,793
Shen Haochen...

573
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:11,753
No interviews.

574
00:29:12,593 --> 00:29:13,033
Mr. Shen.

575
00:29:13,073 --> 00:29:13,674
Is Shen Haochen

576
00:29:13,674 --> 00:29:14,474
really your son?

577
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:15,313
If it's not true,

578
00:29:15,313 --> 00:29:17,033
how do you explain the paternity test?

579
00:29:17,313 --> 00:29:18,234
If it is true,

580
00:29:18,313 --> 00:29:19,273
why didn't you

581
00:29:19,313 --> 00:29:20,474
acknowledge him as your son?

582
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:21,833
Do you never want...

583
00:29:21,874 --> 00:29:22,914
Haochen. Look at me!

584
00:29:23,793 --> 00:29:24,353
Let me go!

585
00:29:24,553 --> 00:29:25,394
Don't hold me!

586
00:29:25,434 --> 00:29:26,394
Let me go!

587
00:29:26,753 --> 00:29:28,154
Let me go!

588
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,194
It is okay now.

589
00:29:38,994 --> 00:29:40,874
It seems Shen Haochen
also wants the truth.

590
00:29:40,954 --> 00:29:42,513
Can you tell us the truth?

591
00:29:53,874 --> 00:29:54,793
You're my son.

592
00:29:56,234 --> 00:29:56,714
Mr. Shen.

593
00:29:56,714 --> 00:29:58,634
You just admitted
he is your son out of wedlock.

594
00:29:58,954 --> 00:30:00,194
Who is his real mom?

595
00:30:00,273 --> 00:30:00,833
Where is she?

596
00:30:01,474 --> 00:30:03,273
Rumors say you are getting divorced.

597
00:30:03,793 --> 00:30:05,234
Is Shen Haochen the reason for it?

598
00:30:05,434 --> 00:30:06,994
How's your marriage now?

599
00:30:07,353 --> 00:30:09,194
It's said
Haochen's biological mom drowned.

600
00:30:09,313 --> 00:30:10,714
Did you know about this earlier?

601
00:30:10,753 --> 00:30:11,634
How will you face

602
00:30:11,634 --> 00:30:12,154
the child?

603
00:30:12,154 --> 00:30:13,753
This child is my son.

604
00:30:17,234 --> 00:30:18,994
I am Shen Haochen's mom.

605
00:30:20,714 --> 00:30:21,634
You've all seen it.

606
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:22,553
My son is not

607
00:30:22,553 --> 00:30:23,353
feeling well.

608
00:30:24,154 --> 00:30:24,753
I hope that you

609
00:30:24,753 --> 00:30:25,994
have professional integrity.

610
00:30:26,073 --> 00:30:27,073
Don't harass

611
00:30:27,113 --> 00:30:27,954
a minor.

612
00:30:28,634 --> 00:30:29,753
We are doing fine.

613
00:30:30,273 --> 00:30:31,033
Don't worry.

614
00:30:31,434 --> 00:30:32,914
But if you continue doing so,

615
00:30:33,154 --> 00:30:34,353
we'll file a lawsuit.

616
00:30:34,553 --> 00:30:35,234
Please make way.

617
00:30:36,394 --> 00:30:37,273
Make way!

618
00:31:01,313 --> 00:31:01,954
Haochen.

619
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:06,833
You haven't eaten

620
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:07,954
all day.

621
00:31:11,793 --> 00:31:13,634
Here's your favorite spareribs,

622
00:31:14,634 --> 00:31:15,674
rice balls,

623
00:31:15,793 --> 00:31:17,194
and pumpkin cubes.

624
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:19,194
All your favorite food.

625
00:31:19,593 --> 00:31:20,273
It smells good.

626
00:31:20,353 --> 00:31:21,434
Let's eat a little,

627
00:31:21,474 --> 00:31:21,994
okay?

628
00:31:22,753 --> 00:31:23,353
Smell it.

629
00:31:29,553 --> 00:31:31,073
Who's that thoughtful,

630
00:31:31,394 --> 00:31:32,353
preparing Haochen's

631
00:31:32,353 --> 00:31:33,434
favorite cola?

632
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:34,674
It's still cold.

633
00:31:35,273 --> 00:31:35,793
Haochen.

634
00:31:38,954 --> 00:31:40,394
Please eat

635
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:41,634
or drink something.

636
00:31:43,073 --> 00:31:43,553
We're really

637
00:31:43,553 --> 00:31:45,073
worried about you!

638
00:31:45,954 --> 00:31:47,273
Haochen, please.

639
00:31:49,714 --> 00:31:50,634
Haochen, come on.

640
00:31:50,634 --> 00:31:52,273
Don't scare me.

641
00:31:52,313 --> 00:31:53,234
Say something.

642
00:31:54,073 --> 00:31:55,113
Let's go out.

643
00:31:55,753 --> 00:31:57,154
Do anything you want.

644
00:31:59,353 --> 00:32:00,954
Please say something, Haochen.

645
00:32:00,994 --> 00:32:01,674
Please.

646
00:32:01,674 --> 00:32:03,434
We're all worried about you!

647
00:32:03,474 --> 00:32:04,194
Haochen.

648
00:32:11,113 --> 00:32:13,874
Shareholders demand another meeting.
Dad is already there.

649
00:32:14,154 --> 00:32:14,833
I must go.

650
00:32:14,954 --> 00:32:15,674
You got this.

651
00:32:15,994 --> 00:32:17,394
Don't worry. I got this.

652
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:18,833
You and Dad take care.

653
00:32:28,793 --> 00:32:33,154
You're here? I get flowers for you.

654
00:32:43,593 --> 00:32:44,154
What's wrong?

655
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:54,313
Did you disclose
the paternity test report?

656
00:32:56,553 --> 00:32:57,674
What paternity test report?

657
00:32:58,313 --> 00:32:59,033
I don't know.

658
00:33:00,634 --> 00:33:01,313
Han Weiping.

659
00:33:01,914 --> 00:33:02,833
Stop pretending!

660
00:33:03,353 --> 00:33:04,073
Only you

661
00:33:04,474 --> 00:33:05,273
kept asking about

662
00:33:05,273 --> 00:33:06,593
my sister and Shen Haoming.

663
00:33:07,714 --> 00:33:08,994
Yes, it was me.

664
00:33:12,513 --> 00:33:13,353
Please leave.

665
00:33:15,073 --> 00:33:17,154
Between us, there will be
no more contact.

666
00:33:27,898 --> 00:33:31,344
(Parallel to Big Dipper)

667
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:36,194
Shen Jinsong.

668
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,874
(2019 Most Influential Entrepreneurs
No. 32: Shen Jinsong)

669
00:33:38,874 --> 00:33:39,954
Entrepreneur.

670
00:33:44,833 --> 00:33:45,753
Qu,

671
00:33:47,593 --> 00:33:50,914
you have 12 percent of shares

672
00:33:50,954 --> 00:33:54,994
of Jinda Group.

673
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:56,313
Right?

674
00:33:57,353 --> 00:34:00,313
Now I have 16.3 percent.

675
00:34:01,553 --> 00:34:02,994
You initiated buybacks

676
00:34:04,234 --> 00:34:06,593
and capped the shares

677
00:34:06,634 --> 00:34:07,833
Situo bought

678
00:34:07,914 --> 00:34:09,354
below 5 percent.

679
00:34:10,994 --> 00:34:12,033
I won by a narrow margin.

680
00:34:13,274 --> 00:34:14,474
Situo

681
00:34:14,954 --> 00:34:17,193
predicted Jinda's trouble.

682
00:34:21,633 --> 00:34:22,274
Haoming,

683
00:34:24,633 --> 00:34:26,914
there's a mole in Jinda.

684
00:34:27,914 --> 00:34:28,593
Otherwise,

685
00:34:29,474 --> 00:34:30,553
Situo wouldn't have

686
00:34:30,954 --> 00:34:32,394
reserved massive funds

687
00:34:32,394 --> 00:34:33,713
to buy shares.

688
00:34:34,394 --> 00:34:35,994
And this mole

689
00:34:36,994 --> 00:34:39,314
is the one who leaked

690
00:34:41,314 --> 00:34:42,274
Haochen's identity.

691
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,274
I just never imagined

692
00:34:46,593 --> 00:34:48,113
it was you.

693
00:34:49,073 --> 00:34:50,474
You should've expected this.

694
00:34:51,474 --> 00:34:53,553
I have been excluded
by you for so many years.

695
00:34:55,233 --> 00:34:56,073
I have attended

696
00:34:57,113 --> 00:34:58,874
few board meetings, right?

697
00:34:59,193 --> 00:35:00,474
Just once or twice.

698
00:35:00,994 --> 00:35:02,834
I was just speaking

699
00:35:03,033 --> 00:35:03,994
on conference calls.

700
00:35:05,713 --> 00:35:06,794
Did you forget

701
00:35:06,794 --> 00:35:07,713
about me?

702
00:35:09,354 --> 00:35:11,673
Holding onto such resentment,

703
00:35:16,474 --> 00:35:17,874
you've had a hard time pretending.

704
00:35:20,274 --> 00:35:21,314
For decades,

705
00:35:21,314 --> 00:35:23,033
you've been acting

706
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:24,394
like my best buddy

707
00:35:24,394 --> 00:35:26,274
in front of everyone.

708
00:35:31,434 --> 00:35:32,394
We started

709
00:35:33,394 --> 00:35:34,834
the business from scratch together.

710
00:35:35,754 --> 00:35:36,874
But after we expanded,

711
00:35:38,434 --> 00:35:39,754
you became a dictator.

712
00:35:40,713 --> 00:35:42,153
We had to obey your orders.

713
00:35:43,994 --> 00:35:45,874
All our founding buddies

714
00:35:45,874 --> 00:35:46,673
from the early days

715
00:35:47,633 --> 00:35:49,274
got exiled by you

716
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:50,513
far from Jingzhou.

717
00:35:51,354 --> 00:35:52,073
Every one of them.

718
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:52,874
Think about it.

719
00:35:55,394 --> 00:35:56,073
Like me,

720
00:35:57,994 --> 00:36:00,914
I have worked in Guangdong for 30 years.

721
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:03,153
If I hadn't explored

722
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:05,153
the market of Hong Kong, China

723
00:36:06,113 --> 00:36:07,994
and defended my territory,

724
00:36:09,513 --> 00:36:13,794
you would kick me out anytime.

725
00:36:17,153 --> 00:36:17,673
Enough.

726
00:36:18,394 --> 00:36:19,314
You've occupied

727
00:36:19,994 --> 00:36:21,193
this position for decades.

728
00:36:22,633 --> 00:36:23,914
Time for someone new.

729
00:36:30,073 --> 00:36:31,474
Your beard has turned white,

730
00:36:33,113 --> 00:36:34,954
and you aimed at a child?

731
00:36:36,434 --> 00:36:37,673
How despicable!

732
00:36:40,233 --> 00:36:41,754
There's an old saying,

733
00:36:42,073 --> 00:36:46,233
"always hit where it hurts."

734
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:48,314
It's a fight,

735
00:36:49,434 --> 00:36:50,834
so why care about morals?

736
00:36:55,354 --> 00:36:56,033
Haoming.

737
00:36:57,834 --> 00:36:59,033
Han Weiping

738
00:36:59,914 --> 00:37:01,073
is your lawyer, right?

739
00:37:03,794 --> 00:37:05,153
He's my godson.

740
00:37:23,233 --> 00:37:24,434
That bad guy!

741
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:29,113
Dad!

742
00:37:30,153 --> 00:37:31,073
Dad! Dad!

743
00:37:33,553 --> 00:37:34,274
Help!

744
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:36,794
Call an ambulance!

745
00:37:39,066 --> 00:37:42,608
(Jingzhou Yuekang Hospital)

746
00:37:50,153 --> 00:37:50,633
Doctor,

747
00:37:51,593 --> 00:37:52,113
how is he?

748
00:37:52,434 --> 00:37:53,153
The surgery

749
00:37:53,394 --> 00:37:54,434
was successful.

750
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:56,713
The patient had a ruptured aneurysm

751
00:37:56,994 --> 00:37:58,474
with subarachnoid hemorrhage.

752
00:37:58,874 --> 00:37:59,553
The surgery

753
00:37:59,593 --> 00:38:00,193
has stabilized

754
00:38:00,193 --> 00:38:01,233
his condition.

755
00:38:03,394 --> 00:38:04,593
When will he wake up?

756
00:38:05,153 --> 00:38:06,794
It is hard to tell.

757
00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:07,914
So you should

758
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:09,754
be prepared.

759
00:38:23,193 --> 00:38:23,593
Mom,

760
00:38:24,914 --> 00:38:25,633
it's okay.

761
00:38:27,834 --> 00:38:29,434
Let's wait patiently until Dad wakes up.

762
00:38:29,513 --> 00:38:29,874
Okay?

763
00:38:30,193 --> 00:38:30,994
Don't worry.

764
00:38:32,193 --> 00:38:33,233
Your dad

765
00:38:34,954 --> 00:38:36,314
has managed the group for years.

766
00:38:40,513 --> 00:38:41,593
We've weathered

767
00:38:41,593 --> 00:38:42,754
countless storms together.

768
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:46,713
He'll overcome

769
00:38:49,754 --> 00:38:50,874
this hurdle too.

770
00:38:52,033 --> 00:38:53,073
He definitely will.

771
00:38:56,073 --> 00:38:57,354
You look exhausted.

772
00:38:58,153 --> 00:38:59,673
I'll stay here.

773
00:38:59,874 --> 00:39:01,073
Go home and rest. Okay?

774
00:39:01,794 --> 00:39:02,314
No need.

775
00:39:13,274 --> 00:39:14,874
I'm staying here.

776
00:39:16,713 --> 00:39:18,513
I need to see him wake up.

777
00:39:24,713 --> 00:39:26,914
Qu Mingcheng schemed against your dad.

778
00:39:28,314 --> 00:39:30,193
I won't let him get away with this.

779
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:36,914
Hello.

780
00:39:37,474 --> 00:39:37,954
Haoming,

781
00:39:38,394 --> 00:39:39,593
how's your dad now?

782
00:39:40,954 --> 00:39:41,914
He is out of surgery.

783
00:39:42,673 --> 00:39:43,914
It is still uncertain.

784
00:39:46,274 --> 00:39:46,914
I'll stay

785
00:39:46,954 --> 00:39:48,113
with Mom at the hospital.

786
00:39:48,954 --> 00:39:49,994
Help take care of Haochen.

787
00:39:51,633 --> 00:39:52,193
I see.

788
00:39:52,874 --> 00:39:54,073
I'll stay with Haochen.

789
00:39:54,673 --> 00:39:55,474
Don't worry.

790
00:39:56,113 --> 00:39:57,233
Dad will definitely recover.

791
00:40:11,354 --> 00:40:12,113
Has he eaten?

792
00:40:12,754 --> 00:40:13,593
No.

793
00:40:14,354 --> 00:40:15,754
He stays locked in his room,

794
00:40:15,754 --> 00:40:17,193
without saying a word.

795
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:18,834
He's usually

796
00:40:19,233 --> 00:40:20,233
such an energetic child.

797
00:40:20,233 --> 00:40:20,834
But now...

798
00:40:24,794 --> 00:40:25,713
I'll go, Hui.

799
00:40:36,274 --> 00:40:36,954
Haochen.

800
00:40:37,874 --> 00:40:38,874
I'm coming in.

801
00:41:00,593 --> 00:41:01,193
Haochen.

802
00:41:02,153 --> 00:41:03,994
If you don't eat,

803
00:41:04,954 --> 00:41:06,274
your body will collapse.

804
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:18,474
How about this?

805
00:41:28,633 --> 00:41:29,153
Look.

806
00:41:29,874 --> 00:41:31,113
I'll leave

807
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,233
a pen and notebook here.

808
00:41:32,874 --> 00:41:33,914
We'll talk through this.

809
00:41:34,553 --> 00:41:35,474
Write down whatever

810
00:41:35,474 --> 00:41:36,274
you want to eat.

811
00:41:38,314 --> 00:41:38,794
Okay?

812
00:41:53,474 --> 00:41:55,193
It's a beautiful day today.

813
00:41:55,954 --> 00:41:57,113
And the sun isn't too strong.

814
00:41:58,153 --> 00:42:01,193
Perfect for skateboarding.

815
00:42:01,434 --> 00:42:02,233
Want to go out?

816
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,233
You don't want to go out

817
00:42:12,633 --> 00:42:18,434
or speak? You don't want to talk to me?

818
00:42:24,553 --> 00:42:25,153
Alright then.

819
00:42:27,394 --> 00:42:28,553
I'll stay here with you.

820
00:42:28,593 --> 00:42:29,073
Okay?

821
00:42:30,794 --> 00:42:31,713
Good boy, Haochen.

822
00:43:32,354 --> 00:43:33,033
Jinsong.

823
00:43:36,193 --> 00:43:37,754
Haoming and I are both here with you.

824
00:43:40,394 --> 00:43:41,673
You must wake up.

825
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:47,153
We're waiting for you.

826
00:43:56,474 --> 00:43:58,033
You must wake up.

827
00:44:15,314 --> 00:44:15,914
Haoming,

828
00:44:19,033 --> 00:44:19,994
I check on your dad.

829
00:44:20,673 --> 00:44:21,153
Here.

830
00:44:22,513 --> 00:44:23,633
Mom, let me introduce.

831
00:44:23,754 --> 00:44:24,914
Yu Yiming, Dr. Yu,

832
00:44:25,553 --> 00:44:27,434
the boyfriend of Xu Yan's sister.

833
00:44:28,434 --> 00:44:28,914
Hello.

834
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:29,553
Hello.

835
00:44:35,033 --> 00:44:35,914
How is he doing?

836
00:44:37,073 --> 00:44:40,754
He is conscious, with stable condition.

837
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:42,914
But he's not awake.

838
00:44:44,274 --> 00:44:45,314
It is good enough.

839
00:44:46,593 --> 00:44:47,513
It takes time.

840
00:44:47,914 --> 00:44:49,113
He has just had surgery

841
00:44:49,314 --> 00:44:50,394
and needs time to recover.

842
00:44:53,354 --> 00:44:53,834
Madam.

843
00:44:54,834 --> 00:44:56,113
His attending physician

844
00:44:56,314 --> 00:44:57,354
is my mentor's classmate,

845
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,713
also the expert in neurosurgery.

846
00:44:59,954 --> 00:45:00,914
I just met him

847
00:45:01,394 --> 00:45:01,994
and asked him

848
00:45:02,474 --> 00:45:03,434
to pay more attention.

849
00:45:04,834 --> 00:45:05,954
Thank you, Yu.

850
00:45:06,874 --> 00:45:07,394
No problem.

851
00:45:07,633 --> 00:45:08,233
It's nothing.

852
00:45:08,314 --> 00:45:09,113
We're family.

853
00:45:09,713 --> 00:45:11,434
Thank you for coming.

854
00:45:13,713 --> 00:45:14,673
He needs rest.

855
00:45:16,033 --> 00:45:17,033
I'll take my leave.

856
00:45:17,553 --> 00:45:18,673
I just want to say

857
00:45:19,354 --> 00:45:20,314
if you need any help,

858
00:45:20,394 --> 00:45:21,153
tell me anytime.

859
00:45:21,513 --> 00:45:23,513
I can help you
with night shifts and rotations.

860
00:45:24,794 --> 00:45:25,314
Thank you.

861
00:45:26,434 --> 00:45:27,153
Rest assured.

862
00:45:27,673 --> 00:45:28,153
Thank you.

863
00:45:28,513 --> 00:45:29,233
I'm going back.

864
00:45:38,233 --> 00:45:38,954
Where's the child?

865
00:45:40,474 --> 00:45:41,113
In his room.

866
00:45:43,354 --> 00:45:46,073
He doesn't eat, drink, or say a word.

867
00:45:47,874 --> 00:45:48,994
I don't know what to do.

868
00:45:49,073 --> 00:45:52,073
But I can just stay with him.

869
00:45:55,994 --> 00:45:58,394
While caring for him,
you also take care of yourself.

870
00:45:59,314 --> 00:46:00,834
Yu Yiming went to the hospital.

871
00:46:02,033 --> 00:46:02,513
Okay.

872
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:05,673
Thank you and Yiming.

873
00:46:09,153 --> 00:46:11,593
I've been swamped lately.

874
00:46:11,713 --> 00:46:12,954
So please take care

875
00:46:13,673 --> 00:46:14,513
of the company.

876
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:16,394
Rest assured.

877
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,434
With such a big incident,

878
00:46:19,633 --> 00:46:21,193
Haoming must be concerned too.

879
00:46:21,593 --> 00:46:23,033
His father and son need his care.

880
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:25,474
It's okay.

881
00:46:25,914 --> 00:46:26,513
You stay here

882
00:46:26,513 --> 00:46:27,434
and share his burdens.

883
00:46:27,633 --> 00:46:28,834
We've got the company covered.

884
00:46:33,033 --> 00:46:34,593
Gubei Town's botanical dyeing project

885
00:46:34,673 --> 00:46:36,153
and our physical stores

886
00:46:36,274 --> 00:46:37,354
are progressing as usual.

887
00:46:37,994 --> 00:46:39,113
If you have any question,

888
00:46:39,153 --> 00:46:40,354
just call me.

889
00:46:40,513 --> 00:46:42,073
Got it. Don't worry.

890
00:46:46,914 --> 00:46:47,474
Have water.

891
00:46:59,553 --> 00:47:00,153
Hello. Lin.

892
00:47:00,994 --> 00:47:01,553
Yiming.

893
00:47:02,193 --> 00:47:03,673
I just met Yan.

894
00:47:03,874 --> 00:47:04,274
I have

895
00:47:04,274 --> 00:47:05,153
met the doctor

896
00:47:05,593 --> 00:47:06,394
and told Haoming

897
00:47:06,434 --> 00:47:08,754
to call us anytime

898
00:47:08,834 --> 00:47:09,593
if he needs help.

899
00:47:10,834 --> 00:47:11,553
I've told her too.

900
00:47:12,834 --> 00:47:13,474
Yiming.

901
00:47:13,673 --> 00:47:15,394
Yan has been swamped lately.

902
00:47:15,914 --> 00:47:17,274
I need to take care

903
00:47:17,274 --> 00:47:18,354
of Yan Studio.

904
00:47:18,874 --> 00:47:21,233
Wait until this busy period ends,

905
00:47:21,233 --> 00:47:22,754
I'll make it up to you.

906
00:47:24,193 --> 00:47:25,113
Special times.

907
00:47:25,314 --> 00:47:25,954
I understand.

908
00:47:26,673 --> 00:47:27,794
Let's help share

909
00:47:27,914 --> 00:47:28,673
their burdens.

910
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,233
But don't

911
00:47:30,233 --> 00:47:31,113
overwork yourself.

912
00:47:31,754 --> 00:47:32,394
Love you!

913
00:47:33,033 --> 00:47:33,874
I'll hang up.

914
00:47:34,874 --> 00:47:35,354
Okay.

915
00:47:35,834 --> 00:47:36,314
Bye.

916
00:47:55,033 --> 00:47:55,553
Thank you.

917
00:47:56,394 --> 00:47:56,954
