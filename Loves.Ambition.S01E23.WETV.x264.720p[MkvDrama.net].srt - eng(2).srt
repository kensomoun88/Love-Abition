00:02:00,944 --> 00:02:01,465
Alright.

37
00:02:19,424 --> 00:02:20,464
Hello, Ms. Song.

38
00:02:21,385 --> 00:02:22,505
Did anything go wrong

39
00:02:22,505 --> 00:02:23,864
with Haochen at school?

40
00:02:25,505 --> 00:02:26,024
No.

41
00:02:26,424 --> 00:02:27,985
Haochen's doing well.

42
00:02:29,904 --> 00:02:30,985
Do you have a minute?

43
00:02:33,424 --> 00:02:33,945
Yeah.

44
00:02:34,065 --> 00:02:35,624
It's Parents' Day next Saturday.

45
00:02:35,704 --> 00:02:36,385
Got it.

Brother-in-law.

48
00:02:43,265 --> 00:02:44,385
Interesting paragraph.

49
00:02:45,704 --> 00:02:47,304
Even for a married couple,

50
00:02:48,024 --> 00:02:50,304
what keeps the marriage alive

51
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:51,304
isn't the certificate

52
00:02:52,024 --> 00:02:54,065
or how much they sacrifice

53
00:02:54,545 --> 00:02:55,545
for the relationship.

54
00:02:56,265 --> 00:02:57,624
What really binds them

55
00:02:57,624 --> 00:03:01,265
is their ability
to maintain the relationship

56
00:03:01,665 --> 00:03:03,105
and resolve conflicts.

57
00:03:05,345 --> 00:03:06,545
This is profound.

58
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:08,584
It requires deep thought.

59
00:03:11,265 --> 00:03:12,144
Enjoy.

60
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:12,825
Thank you.

61
00:03:16,184 --> 00:03:17,665
I know the theory,

62
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:19,424
but what should I do?

63
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:23,704
Listen to this.

64
00:03:24,945 --> 00:03:27,304
World Literary Masters on Love.

65
00:03:28,105 --> 00:03:29,584
Maugham said,

66
00:03:30,265 --> 00:03:31,785
"In matters of love,

67
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:34,065
if you consider self-esteem,

68
00:03:34,345 --> 00:03:35,505
the only explanation

69
00:03:35,744 --> 00:03:38,184
is that you've only
ever loved yourself."

70
00:03:38,424 --> 00:03:38,985
Therefore,

71
00:03:39,505 --> 00:03:40,665
if you really love her

72
00:03:40,945 --> 00:03:41,825
and want her back,

73
00:03:42,545 --> 00:03:45,385
you should completely discard your pride

74
00:03:45,744 --> 00:03:46,624
and take initiative.

75
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:47,744
Be fearless.

76
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:48,904
Be shameless.

77
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:50,704
Don't be afraid

78
00:03:51,505 --> 00:03:52,545
to embarrass yourself.

79
00:04:00,105 --> 00:04:01,105
Are you free tomorrow?

80
00:04:01,265 --> 00:04:02,225
Meet me at the café.

81
00:04:02,505 --> 00:04:03,545
It's about Haochen.

82
00:04:06,624 --> 00:04:08,265
We can meet tomorrow. I...

83
00:04:08,704 --> 00:04:09,345
Don't.

84
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:10,665
Don't send it.

85
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:11,345
Wait.

86
00:04:13,144 --> 00:04:14,345
Not tomorrow.

87
00:04:14,985 --> 00:04:15,624
Today.

88
00:04:15,945 --> 00:04:16,624
Go to her place.

89
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:22,025
You came here fast.

90
00:04:26,944 --> 00:04:27,785
Why are you here?

91
00:04:28,465 --> 00:04:29,624
Didn't we agree to

92
00:04:29,624 --> 00:04:31,184
meet at the café tomorrow?

93
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:34,304
I happened to have a meeting nearby.

94
00:04:34,585 --> 00:04:36,585
So I thought I'd drop by

95
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:38,465
and ask about Haochen.

96
00:04:39,064 --> 00:04:39,905
May I come in?

97
00:04:40,985 --> 00:04:41,824
Shoes off?

98
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:43,384
No need.

99
00:04:50,785 --> 00:04:51,785
It's Parents' Day

100
00:04:51,785 --> 00:04:53,624
next week at Haochen's school.

101
00:04:54,264 --> 00:04:56,585
The parent organizing this time

102
00:04:56,585 --> 00:04:59,025
wants me to share our last event's plan.

103
00:04:59,264 --> 00:05:01,705
But I've been swamped with work.

104
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:03,184
And I can't reach her.

105
00:05:03,465 --> 00:05:05,145
I'll send you the documents.

106
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,504
Contact her, okay?

107
00:05:08,585 --> 00:05:09,744
You're having guests?

108
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:11,545
I sent you the link.

109
00:05:11,624 --> 00:05:12,585
Did you get it?

110
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,025
Just download it.

111
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,792
Okay.

112
00:05:19,665 --> 00:05:20,345
Received it?

113
00:05:23,665 --> 00:05:24,384
Poor connection.

114
00:05:25,985 --> 00:05:27,025
Do you have Wi-Fi here?

115
00:05:28,705 --> 00:05:31,585
My router's broken.
Download it when you get home.

116
00:05:31,585 --> 00:05:32,905
Let me fix it for you.

117
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,785
I've scheduled a repair.

118
00:05:34,785 --> 00:05:36,345
I got this. It'll be quick.

119
00:05:36,424 --> 00:05:37,304
I'll fix it.

120
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:43,465
T-Thank you.

121
00:05:45,624 --> 00:05:46,785
It just needs a reboot.

122
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:51,824
Okay.

123
00:05:52,864 --> 00:05:53,424
Yan.

124
00:05:53,905 --> 00:05:55,905
What's your Wi-Fi password?

125
00:05:55,985 --> 00:05:57,145
My phone number.

126
00:05:57,145 --> 00:05:57,744
Okay.

127
00:05:58,105 --> 00:05:59,145
- 100.
- 100...

129
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:04,304
Let's see.

130
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:09,944
Still not working.

131
00:06:11,864 --> 00:06:12,905
Do you have a modem?

132
00:06:12,944 --> 00:06:13,465
Where is it?

133
00:06:16,145 --> 00:06:17,744
Just download it at home.

134
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:19,025
It'll be quick.

135
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:20,064
Where's the modem?

136
00:06:20,864 --> 00:06:23,864
The modem is in the shoe cabinet.

137
00:06:23,864 --> 00:06:24,545
Got it.

138
00:06:24,905 --> 00:06:25,744
Go ahead.

139
00:06:33,545 --> 00:06:34,184
Found it.

140
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:46,944
Let's see the living room signal.

141
00:06:49,145 --> 00:06:49,905
It's good now.

142
00:06:52,665 --> 00:06:54,744
Mind if I check your bedroom

143
00:06:55,304 --> 00:06:56,545
for the signal?

144
00:06:57,304 --> 00:06:57,864
Go ahead.

145
00:07:00,465 --> 00:07:01,064
Yan.

146
00:07:01,064 --> 00:07:02,585
Do you mind if I close the door?

147
00:07:04,025 --> 00:07:05,304
It's more accurate.

148
00:07:06,585 --> 00:07:07,264
It'll be quick.

149
00:07:08,705 --> 00:07:09,384
Alright.

150
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:43,312
Looking for something?

151
00:07:48,345 --> 00:07:52,345
Good signal under and above the bed.

152
00:07:53,864 --> 00:07:54,785
Full coverage.

153
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:56,905
The bathroom.

154
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:07,785
Perfect.

155
00:08:07,824 --> 00:08:08,345
Finally,

156
00:08:08,424 --> 00:08:09,145
by the window.

157
00:08:14,905 --> 00:08:16,225
You have full coverage now.

158
00:08:16,824 --> 00:08:17,665
That's great.

159
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:19,864
Thank you so much.

160
00:08:21,025 --> 00:08:24,304
Go back and check the documents.

161
00:08:27,184 --> 00:08:28,145
I'll get going then.

162
00:08:28,824 --> 00:08:29,465
Bye.

163
00:08:31,985 --> 00:08:33,144
These curtains...

164
00:08:33,144 --> 00:08:33,664
No.

165
00:08:33,784 --> 00:08:35,225
I-I can change them myself.

166
00:08:35,345 --> 00:08:36,504
It's fine. I'll help you.

167
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:39,225
It's dangerous and tiring for girls.

168
00:08:39,225 --> 00:08:40,504
You don't have to do this.

169
00:08:40,504 --> 00:08:41,465
It's okay. I got this.

170
00:08:44,752 --> 00:08:45,744
Shen Haoming.

171
00:08:46,504 --> 00:08:47,544
Smells amazing.

172
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:49,185
What soup are you making?

173
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:51,144
Coconut chicken soup.

174
00:08:52,345 --> 00:08:53,384
Careful there.

175
00:08:58,305 --> 00:08:59,945
This is your signature soup.

176
00:09:16,985 --> 00:09:18,744
Must be an important guest.

177
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:26,264
Yan, look.

178
00:09:26,904 --> 00:09:27,744
Smooth, right?

179
00:09:31,144 --> 00:09:32,705
Thanks. You've worked hard today.

180
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:35,024
My pleasure.

181
00:09:47,744 --> 00:09:49,392
You cooked quite a feast today.

182
00:09:55,624 --> 00:09:56,585
It's already dark.

183
00:09:56,624 --> 00:09:57,544
Head back home.

184
00:09:58,024 --> 00:09:59,504
Pay more attention to Haochen.

185
00:09:59,544 --> 00:10:00,864
Ask me if you need help.

186
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:01,784
Alright then.

187
00:10:02,864 --> 00:10:03,784
I'll go back now.

188
00:10:06,544 --> 00:10:08,705
Call me if your Wi-Fi ever fails again.

189
00:10:08,904 --> 00:10:09,985
Okay. Thanks.

190
00:10:15,144 --> 00:10:16,144
Finally here.

191
00:10:16,264 --> 00:10:17,024
What did you say?

192
00:10:17,904 --> 00:10:19,024
Your guest has arrived.

193
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:22,225
Go ahead.

194
00:10:22,784 --> 00:10:23,544
I'll get the door.

195
00:10:27,345 --> 00:10:28,225
Shen Haoming?

196
00:10:28,816 --> 00:10:29,624
Sister.

197
00:10:30,185 --> 00:10:31,144
Long time no see.

198
00:10:31,504 --> 00:10:32,504
Come on in.

199
00:10:35,425 --> 00:10:35,985
Yao.

200
00:10:36,305 --> 00:10:36,904
Guan.

201
00:10:37,624 --> 00:10:38,225
Hello.

202
00:10:38,465 --> 00:10:39,345
I'm Shen Haoming.

203
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:43,945
Don't stand there.

204
00:10:43,985 --> 00:10:44,585
Come in.

205
00:10:44,904 --> 00:10:45,624
Keep the shoes on.

206
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:54,465
Yan.

207
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:55,544
I brought fruits.

208
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:56,264
Yan.

209
00:10:56,496 --> 00:10:57,105
A cake for you.

210
00:10:57,105 --> 00:10:57,744
Thank you.

211
00:10:57,784 --> 00:10:58,384
Thank you.

212
00:11:00,225 --> 00:11:00,825
Sit.

213
00:11:01,904 --> 00:11:03,185
I'll get you some drinks.

214
00:11:06,985 --> 00:11:08,065
What are you doing?

215
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,864
Your sister and besties are here.

216
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:13,264
We should treat them well.

217
00:11:14,024 --> 00:11:14,705
Shen Haoming.

218
00:11:20,825 --> 00:11:21,384
Is this okay?

219
00:11:21,465 --> 00:11:22,465
Okay, thanks.

220
00:11:22,864 --> 00:11:23,465
What happened?

221
00:11:23,825 --> 00:11:24,624
Why is he here?

222
00:11:25,425 --> 00:11:26,024
No idea.

223
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:28,144
He fixed the router

224
00:11:28,585 --> 00:11:30,024
and changed the curtains.

225
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,425
I don't know why he won't leave.

226
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:33,585
He won't leave?

227
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:35,384
Okay, let him stay.

228
00:11:36,065 --> 00:11:37,065
Let me handle this.

229
00:11:45,225 --> 00:11:48,225
Thank you for taking care of Yan

230
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:49,904
this whole time.

231
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:53,065
You've worked hard

232
00:11:53,585 --> 00:11:55,065
and achieved such great results

233
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:56,384
in such a short time.

234
00:11:56,705 --> 00:11:57,945
As her husband,

235
00:11:58,544 --> 00:12:00,225
I'm really proud.

236
00:12:00,825 --> 00:12:02,345
It's such a nice opportunity

237
00:12:02,345 --> 00:12:04,504
to meet you and hang out here.

238
00:12:09,985 --> 00:12:10,784
Annoying ex.

239
00:12:10,784 --> 00:12:12,024
Why is he texting me again?

240
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:12,904
So annoying.

241
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:13,784
Unbelievable.

242
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:16,664
You haven't blocked him?

243
00:12:21,705 --> 00:12:24,425
She shouldn't just delete his contact.

244
00:12:24,585 --> 00:12:26,624
She should curse him every now and then,

245
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:27,425
block him,

246
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:29,664
unblock him after some time,

247
00:12:29,744 --> 00:12:30,624
curse him again,

248
00:12:30,864 --> 00:12:31,504
and block him.

249
00:12:32,504 --> 00:12:34,225
That's what he deserves.

250
00:12:35,585 --> 00:12:37,305
Some men are just like that.

251
00:12:37,544 --> 00:12:39,624
When someone is in love with them,

252
00:12:39,784 --> 00:12:40,784
they take it for granted.

253
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:42,544
But when that love fades,

254
00:12:43,024 --> 00:12:44,504
they suddenly can't let go.

255
00:12:45,305 --> 00:12:46,744
Aren't they mentally ill?

256
00:12:46,985 --> 00:12:48,024
Yes, they are.

257
00:12:48,305 --> 00:12:50,105
Those people are abnormal.

258
00:12:52,585 --> 00:12:54,065
Don't be afraid...

259
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:55,225
To embarrass yourself.

260
00:12:56,784 --> 00:12:58,425
Let's play a game.

261
00:12:58,624 --> 00:12:59,784
Use two-word phrases

262
00:12:59,784 --> 00:13:00,705
to describe our exes.

263
00:13:00,705 --> 00:13:01,264
Okay?

264
00:13:01,705 --> 00:13:02,705
I'll go first.

265
00:13:03,185 --> 00:13:04,465
Stubborn fool.

266
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,664
Blind idiot.

267
00:13:06,985 --> 00:13:08,065
Calculating brat.

268
00:13:08,504 --> 00:13:09,185
One more.

269
00:13:09,784 --> 00:13:10,624
Ungrateful wretch.

270
00:13:11,185 --> 00:13:11,945
Nice.

271
00:13:12,144 --> 00:13:14,305
So how should we treat them?

272
00:13:14,384 --> 00:13:15,624
Obviously,

273
00:13:15,904 --> 00:13:18,305
leave them to die alone.

274
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:19,945
Destitute in old age.

275
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,784
And what kind of attitude

276
00:13:22,784 --> 00:13:24,024
should we adopt?

277
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,504
Ignore them.

278
00:13:27,784 --> 00:13:30,024
Act like they're dead.

279
00:13:32,705 --> 00:13:33,225
Oh right,

280
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:35,544
Jinda Group's new mall

281
00:13:35,585 --> 00:13:37,504
is opening soon.

282
00:13:38,465 --> 00:13:40,144
Feel free to visit.

283
00:13:40,544 --> 00:13:42,585
Buy whatever you like.

284
00:13:43,384 --> 00:13:44,384
My treat.

285
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:45,825
Your treat?

286
00:13:49,425 --> 00:13:50,504
How much discount?

287
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:51,825
All for free.

288
00:13:56,024 --> 00:13:59,945
My secretary will go with you.

289
00:14:02,185 --> 00:14:04,744
Mr. Shen is absolutely

290
00:14:05,305 --> 00:14:06,345
approachable.

291
00:14:06,904 --> 00:14:07,945
Confident and kind.

292
00:14:08,664 --> 00:14:09,784
Peerlessly handsome.

293
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:11,465
A true gentleman.

294
00:14:19,624 --> 00:14:21,065
Showing off your vocabulary?

295
00:14:21,664 --> 00:14:23,105
You know so many phrases, huh?

296
00:14:23,264 --> 00:14:24,825
Ms. Xu is cooking alone.

297
00:14:24,825 --> 00:14:25,864
Won't you help her?

298
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:26,664
Yeah.

299
00:14:27,664 --> 00:14:28,345
- I forgot.
- Hurry.

300
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:29,105
Let's help her.

301
00:14:29,105 --> 00:14:29,585
Let's go.

302
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:30,945
Ms. Xu.

303
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:32,024
Ms. Xu.

304
00:14:32,425 --> 00:14:33,384
Ms. Xu.

305
00:14:33,425 --> 00:14:34,384
Let us do this.

306
00:14:34,585 --> 00:14:35,024
Ms. Xu.

307
00:14:35,024 --> 00:14:35,744
Take a break.

308
00:14:35,784 --> 00:14:36,544
Rest for a bit.

309
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:37,585
We've got this.

310
00:14:43,744 --> 00:14:45,185
Why don't you go home?

311
00:14:45,465 --> 00:14:47,585
It's your first time
attending Parents' Day.

312
00:14:47,585 --> 00:14:49,305
There is a lot to do.

313
00:14:50,065 --> 00:14:50,705
It's fine.

314
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:52,705
Let me talk with Lin a bit more.

315
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,000
I have nothing to say to you.

316
00:14:56,784 --> 00:14:57,504
Alright.

317
00:14:58,345 --> 00:14:59,144
Then I'm off.

318
00:15:00,384 --> 00:15:01,465
Call me if you need help

319
00:15:02,024 --> 00:15:03,056
with your Wi-Fi.

320
00:15:05,784 --> 00:15:06,345
Ladies,

321
00:15:06,825 --> 00:15:09,185
Jinda Mall welcomes you anytime.

322
00:15:10,345 --> 00:15:11,105
Thanks, Mr. Shen.

323
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:12,225
Bye, Mr. Shen.

324
00:15:19,472 --> 00:15:21,784
He acted like the host here.

325
00:15:23,065 --> 00:15:23,945
So shameless.

326
00:15:24,065 --> 00:15:24,945
I don't get it.

327
00:15:25,345 --> 00:15:25,985
Forget it.

328
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,065
Come on, let's eat.

329
00:15:28,504 --> 00:15:29,264
Let's eat.

330
00:15:29,305 --> 00:15:30,024
Set the table.

331
00:15:30,024 --> 00:15:31,185
You have the appetite?

332
00:15:32,705 --> 00:15:33,705
What happened just now?

333
00:15:34,065 --> 00:15:35,985
You betrayed your friend

334
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:37,144
for some petty money?

335
00:15:38,384 --> 00:15:39,024
Brother-in-law.

336
00:15:40,264 --> 00:15:41,504
Why does the drink

337
00:15:42,345 --> 00:15:43,264
taste so bitter today?

338
00:15:49,664 --> 00:15:50,352
Brother-in-law.

339
00:15:51,504 --> 00:15:53,985
Your sadness and sorrow
have been transmitted

340
00:15:54,544 --> 00:15:55,544
to the brain,

341
00:15:56,504 --> 00:15:59,024
which then signals the glands.

342
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:02,425
These glands received neural stimulation

343
00:16:03,065 --> 00:16:04,345
and secreted melatonin,

344
00:16:05,144 --> 00:16:06,105
causing low mood.

345
00:16:06,105 --> 00:16:06,904
It's normal.

346
00:16:08,784 --> 00:16:10,624
Just take some Vitamin B.

347
00:16:14,185 --> 00:16:14,705
Yeah.

348
00:16:16,345 --> 00:16:18,384
My previous advice was wrong.

349
00:16:19,705 --> 00:16:20,345
As you know,

350
00:16:20,945 --> 00:16:23,105
we doctors have
multiple treatment plans.

351
00:16:25,825 --> 00:16:27,185
There's a Plan B?

352
00:16:27,544 --> 00:16:28,144
Of course.

353
00:16:28,425 --> 00:16:29,305
(Excerpt)
Your longing,

354
00:16:30,624 --> 00:16:31,425
your regrets,

355
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,225
and your anguish

356
00:16:34,985 --> 00:16:36,504
should all be shown to them.

357
00:16:37,185 --> 00:16:38,504
As they say, "When a man cries,

358
00:16:38,504 --> 00:16:39,624
a woman's heart softens."

359
00:16:41,345 --> 00:16:44,624
The second tactic is to be love-sick.

360
00:16:51,408 --> 00:16:54,161
(Yan Studio)

361
00:17:00,024 --> 00:17:00,945
What brings you here?

362
00:17:02,384 --> 00:17:02,985
Thanks.

363
00:17:04,784 --> 00:17:05,385
Yan.

364
00:17:06,504 --> 00:17:07,945
I thought about it a lot

365
00:17:08,225 --> 00:17:09,264
and decided that

366
00:17:09,465 --> 00:17:11,024
you should know about this.

367
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:13,504
Look.

368
00:17:16,185 --> 00:17:16,945
What is this?

369
00:17:24,064 --> 00:17:26,465
These are candid shots I took.

370
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:31,784
When you were away,

371
00:17:32,465 --> 00:17:33,744
he often visited your building.

372
00:17:34,784 --> 00:17:36,225
Many times, he almost went up,

373
00:17:38,344 --> 00:17:39,504
but always gave up.

374
00:18:07,024 --> 00:18:08,344
And he's been staring

375
00:18:09,344 --> 00:18:10,625
out of the windows at work.

376
00:18:14,544 --> 00:18:15,465
There's more.

377
00:18:16,064 --> 00:18:16,945
When he was sent

378
00:18:16,945 --> 00:18:18,185
to a regional subsidiary,

379
00:18:18,905 --> 00:18:20,264
I secretly took some photos.

380
00:18:22,504 --> 00:18:23,705
The local manager

381
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:26,665
picked on him to block his audit.

382
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:29,225
Mr. Shen fought alone

383
00:18:29,225 --> 00:18:30,465
in unfamiliar territory.

384
00:18:32,665 --> 00:18:34,344
What got him through the nights?

385
00:18:34,705 --> 00:18:35,824
Your photos.

386
00:18:39,504 --> 00:18:40,225
Yan.

387
00:18:41,225 --> 00:18:42,544
I can tell

388
00:18:43,304 --> 00:18:44,544
that you're everything

389
00:18:44,705 --> 00:18:46,185
to Mr. Shen.

390
00:18:48,784 --> 00:18:49,985
I haven't seen him smile

391
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,665
for a long time since you left.

392
00:18:56,104 --> 00:18:58,344
You're really important to him.

393
00:19:09,504 --> 00:19:10,264
I see.

394
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:13,784
The photos are well taken

395
00:19:14,465 --> 00:19:15,425
and clear.

396
00:19:15,544 --> 00:19:16,225
Good work.

397
00:19:16,945 --> 00:19:18,385
I just want to know

398
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:21,304
what kind of candid shots
could get this close?

399
00:19:22,584 --> 00:19:24,504
Shen Haoming seemed quite cooperative.

400
00:19:26,705 --> 00:19:27,425
And this one.

401
00:19:29,425 --> 00:19:30,784
He was in bed, right?

402
00:19:31,544 --> 00:19:32,225
Yeah.

403
00:19:32,385 --> 00:19:33,744
So you were in bed too?

404
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:37,344
Both of you were in bed?

405
00:19:42,705 --> 00:19:43,945
Why are you having water?

406
00:19:45,504 --> 00:19:46,665
Why are you nervous?

407
00:19:46,665 --> 00:19:48,264
I get nervous when you're nervous.

408
00:19:51,145 --> 00:19:52,185
And you're blushing?

409
00:19:53,072 --> 00:19:53,865
Well...

410
00:19:58,344 --> 00:19:59,064
You may leave.

411
00:20:07,865 --> 00:20:08,865
(Chen)
I'm sorry, sir.

412
00:20:09,385 --> 00:20:10,145
I failed.

413
00:20:19,472 --> 00:20:20,690
(Yan's WeChat Moment)

414
00:20:32,304 --> 00:20:33,945
(Jiang Liang)
Love preserved in old film reels

415
00:20:33,945 --> 00:20:35,024
is charming because

416
00:20:35,665 --> 00:20:37,465
it focuses on one person.

417
00:20:45,544 --> 00:20:48,544
Radios and film projectors museum.

418
00:20:56,185 --> 00:20:57,824
(Vespa125 motorcycle)
Careful there.

419
00:20:59,744 --> 00:21:00,385
Watch your feet.

420
00:21:00,665 --> 00:21:01,304
Alright.

421
00:21:01,304 --> 00:21:02,705
Put it down here.

422
00:21:15,504 --> 00:21:16,425
Be careful.

423
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:17,064
Be gentle.

424
00:21:17,064 --> 00:21:18,425
- What's going on?
- Be careful.

425
00:21:18,784 --> 00:21:19,376
Stop.

426
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:20,385
Put those down.

427
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:22,104
Mr. Jiang.

428
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,705
We're changing the exhibits.

429
00:21:23,905 --> 00:21:24,945
We'll finish soon.

430
00:21:25,264 --> 00:21:26,145
Who authorized this?

431
00:21:26,344 --> 00:21:26,865
You.

432
00:21:28,185 --> 00:21:28,705
Put it down.

433
00:21:29,465 --> 00:21:31,905
A collector bought all the exhibits

434
00:21:31,905 --> 00:21:32,985
at a hefty price.

435
00:21:33,185 --> 00:21:34,584
He paid and asked for delivery.

436
00:21:34,705 --> 00:21:35,465
They're sold?

437
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,145
Don't you know I'm your boss's friend?

438
00:21:38,544 --> 00:21:39,865
I pay a fortune for maintenance

439
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:40,824
every year

440
00:21:40,824 --> 00:21:41,865
just to see these items.

441
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:42,865
Now they're sold?

442
00:21:42,865 --> 00:21:44,264
What were you thinking?

443
00:21:44,425 --> 00:21:47,024
I-I had no choice.

444
00:21:47,145 --> 00:21:48,584
He paid way too much.

445
00:21:48,665 --> 00:21:49,744
Even our boss agreed...

446
00:21:49,744 --> 00:21:50,256
Who is it?

447
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:52,104
Who's the buyer?

448
00:21:53,425 --> 00:21:55,064
The heir of Jinda Group,

449
00:21:55,344 --> 00:21:56,024
Shen Haoming.

450
00:21:59,744 --> 00:22:00,824
What are you waiting for?

451
00:22:00,824 --> 00:22:01,584
Start loading.

452
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:02,145
Hurry up.

453
00:22:02,264 --> 00:22:03,185
Be careful.

454
00:22:03,385 --> 00:22:05,385
You're causing trouble
in this scorching heat?

455
00:22:06,104 --> 00:22:06,784
Faster.

456
00:22:08,264 --> 00:22:08,824
Be gentle.

457
00:22:10,264 --> 00:22:10,784
Hello?

458
00:22:11,304 --> 00:22:11,985
Let's meet.

459
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:13,985
Alright.

460
00:22:28,225 --> 00:22:28,824
You did this?

461
00:22:31,985 --> 00:22:32,665
Want a drink?

462
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:36,024
Shen Haoming,

463
00:22:36,024 --> 00:22:38,264
I've never seen you so agitated before.

464
00:22:42,665 --> 00:22:44,225
But your actions are understandable.

465
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:46,185
You've finally realized

466
00:22:47,425 --> 00:22:49,824
that the money and connections

467
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:51,264
you took pride in

468
00:22:51,264 --> 00:22:52,425
mean nothing to her now.

469
00:22:56,304 --> 00:22:58,744
Her career is thriving now.

470
00:22:59,865 --> 00:23:01,945
She doesn't need to rely on you anymore.

471
00:23:03,024 --> 00:23:03,784
Meanwhile,

472
00:23:04,225 --> 00:23:05,744
as her partner,

473
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:08,584
I've supported her

474
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:10,824
every step of the way.

475
00:23:12,104 --> 00:23:13,304
Not to mention

476
00:23:14,665 --> 00:23:17,024
that your marital bond is crumbling.

477
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:21,064
Even if our marital bond is crumbling,

478
00:23:21,665 --> 00:23:22,865
as you assume

479
00:23:22,865 --> 00:23:24,344
without any basis,

480
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:29,024
we are still married, aren't we?

481
00:23:30,665 --> 00:23:31,632
I'm still

482
00:23:33,424 --> 00:23:34,985
her legal spouse.

483
00:23:36,344 --> 00:23:39,064
This is indisputable, right?

484
00:23:42,385 --> 00:23:44,905
If you're just an ordinary investor,

485
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,465
I'd appreciate your support for her.

486
00:23:48,104 --> 00:23:49,665
But you'd better not approach her

487
00:23:49,985 --> 00:23:50,945
with ulterior motives.

488
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,504
I won't tolerate anyone who wrecks

489
00:23:56,865 --> 00:23:58,304
people's families.

490
00:23:59,865 --> 00:24:00,665
Shen Haoming,

491
00:24:00,665 --> 00:24:01,945
how can you be so confident?

492
00:24:03,064 --> 00:24:05,264
You've long been excluded from her life.

493
00:24:06,584 --> 00:24:07,905
Do you know who she is today?

494
00:24:11,104 --> 00:24:12,985
Do you know her business scale?

495
00:24:13,465 --> 00:24:15,665
What's Yan Studio's production capacity

496
00:24:15,665 --> 00:24:17,985
for major products in the coming year?

497
00:24:18,304 --> 00:24:19,344
What's the product matrix

498
00:24:19,344 --> 00:24:20,264
she aims to build

499
00:24:20,264 --> 00:24:21,344
within three years?

500
00:24:21,465 --> 00:24:23,225
How much profit increase
does she target?

501
00:24:23,264 --> 00:24:24,744
Do you know any of this?

502
00:24:25,024 --> 00:24:26,744
Do you know how much effort

503
00:24:26,744 --> 00:24:28,905
she's poured into
establishing Yan Studio?

504
00:24:30,905 --> 00:24:32,584
Thank you for reminding me.

505
00:24:33,784 --> 00:24:36,264
I'll make sure to
learn all these details.

506
00:24:42,304 --> 00:24:43,185
However,

507
00:24:44,304 --> 00:24:46,705
I think you might have
overestimated your importance.

508
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:49,504
You just happened to be the investor.

509
00:24:50,705 --> 00:24:53,264
Her success isn't because of you.

510
00:24:54,344 --> 00:24:55,185
Without you,

511
00:24:56,304 --> 00:24:59,344
she could have still
accomplished her goals.

512
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:01,625
And I will always

513
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:03,945
stand firmly by her side.

514
00:25:04,985 --> 00:25:06,104
Whenever she needs me,

515
00:25:06,784 --> 00:25:08,145
I'll be there.

516
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:13,945
Your position is not

517
00:25:15,504 --> 00:25:16,465
so irreplaceable.

518
00:25:17,504 --> 00:25:18,504
Go ahead and try.

519
00:25:28,744 --> 00:25:29,465
Mr. Shen.

520
00:25:30,705 --> 00:25:32,104
Mr. Baraikin has made a request.

521
00:25:32,705 --> 00:25:34,504
Jinda Group must undergo three months

522
00:25:34,625 --> 00:25:36,504
of evaluation
before we sign the contract.

523
00:25:36,985 --> 00:25:38,945
No risks or scandals will be allowed.

524
00:25:39,264 --> 00:25:41,465
Then Mr. Baraikin
will confirm the terms.

525
00:25:42,665 --> 00:25:44,945
Can you find a way

526
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:46,905
to delay the divorce?

527
00:25:51,905 --> 00:25:52,504
Also,

528
00:25:53,544 --> 00:25:56,544
what should I do about
the film equipment?

529
00:25:57,465 --> 00:25:58,945
Store them in a warehouse.

530
00:26:00,824 --> 00:26:01,905
What a waste of money.

531
00:26:02,945 --> 00:26:03,465
Oh.

532
00:26:06,104 --> 00:26:07,584
Buy some cosmetics.

533
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,504
Cosmetics?

534
00:26:08,865 --> 00:26:09,544
For whom?

535
00:26:12,064 --> 00:26:12,625
Someone.

536
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,106
Okay.

537
00:26:21,104 --> 00:26:23,185
Still no leads on Shen Haoming

538
00:26:23,544 --> 00:26:24,625
and Xu Yan's divorce?

539
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,625
They might still be married.

540
00:26:28,425 --> 00:26:29,865
But my instincts at Yanbo Resort

541
00:26:29,865 --> 00:26:30,744
can't be wrong.

542
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:33,744
Something is fishy between them.

543
00:26:34,985 --> 00:26:36,104
They feigned harmony

544
00:26:37,185 --> 00:26:38,865
just to secure the deal with Baraikin.

545
00:26:39,385 --> 00:26:41,425
Xu Yan moved out
and started her own business.

546
00:26:42,104 --> 00:26:43,824
Divorced couples naturally drift apart.

547
00:26:44,225 --> 00:26:45,504
But strangely,

548
00:26:46,145 --> 00:26:48,225
Shen Haoming keeps
mentioning her at work.

549
00:26:48,744 --> 00:26:49,945
They're still intimate.

550
00:26:50,824 --> 00:26:52,744
He's even visited her rented apartment.

551
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,744
Back at Yanbo Resort,

552
00:26:57,264 --> 00:26:58,385
they put on quite a show.

553
00:26:59,945 --> 00:27:01,145
They're kind of romantic.

554
00:27:04,304 --> 00:27:05,865
Even if they're in a fight,

555
00:27:06,304 --> 00:27:08,185
Baraikin's three-month inspection

556
00:27:10,185 --> 00:27:11,385
will make Shen Haoming

557
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,104
try every means to keep Xu Yan

558
00:27:13,104 --> 00:27:13,985
from leaving.

559
00:27:15,945 --> 00:27:17,185
I don't care what you do.

560
00:27:17,824 --> 00:27:18,665
Use Fang Lei

561
00:27:18,985 --> 00:27:20,665
or your legal connections,

562
00:27:21,104 --> 00:27:24,425
obtain evidence of their divorce

563
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,024
or marital breakdown in three months.

564
00:27:27,985 --> 00:27:28,584
Remember.

565
00:27:29,584 --> 00:27:30,985
Don't let your godfather down.

566
00:27:31,504 --> 00:27:33,225
If neither approach works,

567
00:27:34,064 --> 00:27:36,425
Yan Studio can also be the target.

568
00:27:41,185 --> 00:27:41,744
Enjoy.

569
00:27:41,784 --> 00:27:42,320
Thank you.

570
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,425
- Sister...
- No. I'm not your sister.

571
00:27:46,945 --> 00:27:48,425
You'll remain my sister-in-law

572
00:27:48,425 --> 00:27:49,264
until I'm divorced.

573
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,024
I stand by my sister.

574
00:27:51,425 --> 00:27:52,625
I won't persuade her

575
00:27:53,225 --> 00:27:54,705
to reconcile with you.

576
00:27:59,584 --> 00:28:01,344
I tried every possible way

577
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:05,744
to make things right with Yan.

578
00:28:07,784 --> 00:28:08,465
Last month,

579
00:28:08,865 --> 00:28:11,385
we were supposed
to finalize the divorce.

580
00:28:12,945 --> 00:28:14,824
I used every excuse to delay it

581
00:28:15,185 --> 00:28:16,665
and missed the deadline.

582
00:28:21,705 --> 00:28:23,104
That was the first time

583
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:24,905
I avoided facing reality.

584
00:28:25,945 --> 00:28:27,145
It was also the first time

585
00:28:28,304 --> 00:28:30,385
I was so terrified to solve an issue.

586
00:28:33,136 --> 00:28:34,032
Sister.

587
00:28:35,744 --> 00:28:37,264
I don't want to divorce Yan.

588
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,824
I want to win her back.

589
00:28:40,905 --> 00:28:42,945
Why were you so cold when Yan said

590
00:28:44,425 --> 00:28:46,104
she wanted to make things right?

591
00:28:46,705 --> 00:28:47,744
It was my fault.

592
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:50,425
I was convinced that

593
00:28:51,185 --> 00:28:53,784
she couldn't live without me.

594
00:28:55,104 --> 00:28:56,544
But after we parted, I realized

595
00:28:57,905 --> 00:28:59,264
that I can't live without her.

596
00:29:10,425 --> 00:29:11,744
I might be her sister,

597
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,784
but I can't tell her what to do.

598
00:29:15,744 --> 00:29:17,064
Figure this out yourself.

599
00:29:19,985 --> 00:29:21,145
Just don't push me away.

600
00:29:22,744 --> 00:29:23,264
By the way,

601
00:29:24,225 --> 00:29:26,705
I met with Dr. Yu some days ago.

602
00:29:30,304 --> 00:29:32,064
Why did you meet him?

603
00:29:33,945 --> 00:29:35,064
Misery loves company.

604
00:29:39,705 --> 00:29:41,465
His current state...

605
00:29:44,584 --> 00:29:45,264
What...

606
00:29:46,625 --> 00:29:47,264
What's wrong?

607
00:29:52,185 --> 00:29:53,905
Stop beating around the bush.

608
00:29:53,945 --> 00:29:54,705
How is he?

609
00:29:56,985 --> 00:29:57,945
He's in terrible shape,

610
00:29:58,784 --> 00:30:00,185
barely eating or drinking,

611
00:30:00,905 --> 00:30:01,945
hiding his weakness,

612
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,465
while obsessing over

613
00:30:04,905 --> 00:30:06,824
how to win back your favor.

614
00:30:13,744 --> 00:30:15,625
I-I never imagined

615
00:30:16,504 --> 00:30:18,584
you would hang out with Yu Yiming.

616
00:30:21,104 --> 00:30:22,905
It's like the bottom two students

617
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:24,544
helping each other out.

618
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:27,504
You must be truly desperate.

619
00:30:34,945 --> 00:30:36,865
Given your dedication,

620
00:30:37,304 --> 00:30:39,024
I'll give you one more chance.

621
00:30:44,544 --> 00:30:45,744
Yan's been through so much.

622
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:48,385
I hope you can support her.

623
00:30:49,824 --> 00:30:50,425
Tell me.

624
00:30:51,824 --> 00:30:52,824
Tomorrow's Saturday.

625
00:30:53,264 --> 00:30:54,824
Yan will be working overtime.

626
00:30:56,024 --> 00:30:56,705
Okay.

627
00:30:57,504 --> 00:30:58,185
Thanks.

628
00:31:00,336 --> 00:31:01,456
Jiang Liang will be there.

629
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,297
Huh?

630
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:08,905
These are the points I'll address next.

631
00:31:12,344 --> 00:31:13,744
Shen Haoming? Why are you here?

632
00:31:16,064 --> 00:31:17,425
I knew you'd be working late,

633
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,264
so I brought desserts.

634
00:31:20,264 --> 00:31:20,905
Here.

635
00:31:22,145 --> 00:31:23,744
How did you know my schedule?

636
00:31:24,865 --> 00:31:25,465
Look.

637
00:31:26,024 --> 00:31:26,905
There are cookies,

638
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:27,705
pastries,

639
00:31:28,145 --> 00:31:28,665
and...

640
00:31:29,985 --> 00:31:30,945
I'm in a meeting.

641
00:31:35,985 --> 00:31:37,024
Can I observe?

642
00:31:43,665 --> 00:31:44,264
Of course.

643
00:31:44,465 --> 00:31:45,104
Have a seat.

644
00:31:45,865 --> 00:31:46,385
Thank you.

645
00:31:49,024 --> 00:31:49,544
Go on.

646
00:31:51,824 --> 00:31:53,705
My advice is pretty straightforward.

647
00:31:53,905 --> 00:31:54,784
Seek investment.

648
00:31:55,225 --> 00:31:57,625
China has seen
over 44 million new startups

649
00:31:57,625 --> 00:31:59,385
in the past three years.

650
00:31:59,465 --> 00:32:00,344
A new company emerges

651
00:32:00,344 --> 00:32:01,544
every seven seconds.

652
00:32:02,385 --> 00:32:03,625
The one-year survival rate

653
00:32:03,824 --> 00:32:04,784
stands at 20%.

654
00:32:05,304 --> 00:32:06,665
Two years, 4%.

655
00:32:06,784 --> 00:32:09,465
Three years, only 0.8%.

656
00:32:10,425 --> 00:32:10,985
Ms. Xu.

657
00:32:12,304 --> 00:32:15,225
Do you know why
the survival rates are this low?

658
00:32:17,665 --> 00:32:18,824
In my opinion,

659
00:32:19,385 --> 00:32:20,945
they failed to develop

660
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:23,665
a truly market-approved product

661
00:32:24,145 --> 00:32:25,264
or service.

662
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:26,425
Of course,

663
00:32:26,824 --> 00:32:27,784
capital shortages,

664
00:32:28,024 --> 00:32:29,304
talent deficits,

665
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:31,824
market expansion limitations,

666
00:32:32,064 --> 00:32:32,905
and poor management

667
00:32:33,145 --> 00:32:34,465
are also key factors.

668
00:32:35,304 --> 00:32:35,905
Exactly.

669
00:32:36,665 --> 00:32:37,705
For every 100 startups,

670
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:38,865
there are 99 ways to fail.

671
00:32:39,064 --> 00:32:40,385
But the most crucial issue

672
00:32:40,465 --> 00:32:42,064
is undoubtedly funding.

673
00:32:42,584 --> 00:32:44,425
A new brand's cold-start phase

674
00:32:44,945 --> 00:32:46,145
requires 3 million yuan

675
00:32:46,145 --> 00:32:47,665
in one marketing cycle.

676
00:32:48,145 --> 00:32:50,192
The annual marketing expenses
approach 10 million.

677
00:32:50,665 --> 00:32:51,385
To put it bluntly,

678
00:32:52,024 --> 00:32:53,064
if you want fame,

679
00:32:53,425 --> 00:32:54,385
keep the cash flowing.

680
00:32:54,945 --> 00:32:55,705
However,

681
00:32:55,744 --> 00:32:56,824
besides funding,

682
00:32:57,744 --> 00:32:58,905
another critical factor

683
00:32:59,064 --> 00:32:59,905
is product quality.

684
00:33:00,865 --> 00:33:01,905
A strong product

685
00:33:02,024 --> 00:33:03,665
must evolve with market needs

686
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:05,465
through continuous updates.

687
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:08,784
For startups like ours,

688
00:33:09,024 --> 00:33:10,905
the process involves

689
00:33:11,344 --> 00:33:13,185
constant refinement

690
00:33:13,304 --> 00:33:14,385
and trial-and-error.

691
00:33:14,905 --> 00:33:16,385
This entire journey requires

692
00:33:16,385 --> 00:33:17,865
massive financial resources.

693
00:33:19,784 --> 00:33:21,905
Without solid funding,

694
00:33:22,385 --> 00:33:24,705
there is no room for error.

695
00:33:25,705 --> 00:33:27,264
As entrepreneurs,

696
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:30,824
we must prioritize financing

697
00:33:30,824 --> 00:33:32,264
from day one.

698
00:33:33,625 --> 00:33:35,344
Cash flow management

699
00:33:36,465 --> 00:33:37,665
determines survival.

700
00:33:42,304 --> 00:33:43,264
You're right.

701
00:33:44,784 --> 00:33:46,705
Yan Studio has repeatedly

702
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:48,504
faced such crises.

703
00:33:50,504 --> 00:33:52,985
But now you have me and Yuanhang.

704
00:33:59,024 --> 00:34:01,744
We can do much more than inject funds

705
00:34:02,824 --> 00:34:04,304
to support your expansion.

706
00:34:05,104 --> 00:34:06,104
In the long run,

707
00:34:06,705 --> 00:34:08,265
with our lead investment,

708
00:34:08,704 --> 00:34:11,584
funding will never
hinder your growth ever again.

709
00:34:11,785 --> 00:34:13,785
Money solves talent acquisition,

710
00:34:14,064 --> 00:34:15,425
brand building,

711
00:34:15,425 --> 00:34:16,624
and development challenges.

712
00:34:24,184 --> 00:34:26,184
Mr. Shen, any objections?

713
00:34:30,305 --> 00:34:32,985
You've listed so many benefits,

714
00:34:33,785 --> 00:34:35,664
but ignored all the drawbacks.

715
00:34:36,664 --> 00:34:37,392
What do you mean?

716
00:34:38,865 --> 00:34:40,504
The internet ventures

717
00:34:41,624 --> 00:34:44,624
have seen so many
capital-driven successes.

718
00:34:45,265 --> 00:34:46,664
It's nothing new.

719
00:34:47,144 --> 00:34:50,345
But even if you
depict investors as angels,

720
00:34:50,425 --> 00:34:54,104
they are not charities

721
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,425
nor wishing wells.

722
00:34:57,945 --> 00:34:59,504
They're investing in you,

723
00:34:59,745 --> 00:35:01,104
expecting a return

724
00:35:01,104 --> 00:35:03,104
that's dozens or even hundreds of times

725
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:04,745
their initial investment.

726
00:35:06,024 --> 00:35:06,704
Mr. Liang.

727
00:35:07,945 --> 00:35:11,664
Just tell me whether you will sign
a valuation adjustment agreement

728
00:35:11,664 --> 00:35:12,745
with Yan Studio.

729
00:35:24,785 --> 00:35:26,584
Even if Yuanhang requires a return,

730
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,985
it'll be based on Yan Studio's
actual operational performance.

731
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:31,345
I can guarantee

732
00:35:31,945 --> 00:35:34,825
that I'll prioritize Xu Yan
and her co-founders' vision above all

733
00:35:35,544 --> 00:35:36,825
and ensure their autonomy.

734
00:35:37,664 --> 00:35:38,345
You guarantee?

735
00:35:38,385 --> 00:35:38,928
Yeah.

736
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,544
What about the executives?

737
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,544
What about your sister?

738
00:35:43,265 --> 00:35:44,704
Even if your sister agrees,

739
00:35:45,704 --> 00:35:47,624
the company's Articles of Association

740
00:35:47,624 --> 00:35:48,745
won't change.

741
00:35:49,664 --> 00:35:52,465
We know that you remember
every data point

742
00:35:52,465 --> 00:35:53,825
with photographic accuracy.

743
00:35:54,624 --> 00:35:55,785
Recall for yourself.

744
00:35:56,785 --> 00:35:59,945
How many cases follow this pattern?

745
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,508
(Equity valuation bets)

746
00:36:25,144 --> 00:36:27,945
The investors want you to maintain

747
00:36:28,745 --> 00:36:31,385
annual growth rates of 50 percent,

748
00:36:31,785 --> 00:36:34,504
100 percent, or even 200 percent,

749
00:36:34,504 --> 00:36:35,905
which is abnormally high.

750
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:38,584
Why?

751
00:36:39,985 --> 00:36:42,224
To gain a higher valuation

752
00:36:42,224 --> 00:36:43,664
in capital markets.

753
00:36:44,144 --> 00:36:45,704
Such performance clauses

754
00:36:46,064 --> 00:36:48,425
will force you
to conduct rapid expansion

755
00:36:48,905 --> 00:36:51,184
or make prompt
and short-sighted decisions

756
00:36:51,224 --> 00:36:52,624
that damage your fundamentals.

757
00:36:52,905 --> 00:36:54,064
But what happens

758
00:36:55,945 --> 00:36:57,385
if targets aren't met?

759
00:36:58,265 --> 00:37:01,425
Your company would be acquired.

760
00:37:02,265 --> 00:37:03,865
Years of hard work

761
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,544
could vanish overnight.

762
00:37:07,064 --> 00:37:09,664
Do you think you'd still
have the right to refuse then?

763
00:37:18,064 --> 00:37:21,184
Or do you want to create

764
00:37:21,224 --> 00:37:22,224
a quick-profit brand?

765
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:23,985
Something marketable to sell

766
00:37:24,024 --> 00:37:25,704
at peak value for fast returns?

767
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:26,704
That's not our goal.

768
00:37:27,425 --> 00:37:29,584
Yan Studio never intended to become

769
00:37:29,624 --> 00:37:30,865
a rapidly expanding

770
00:37:30,945 --> 00:37:32,785
copycat business model.

771
00:37:33,224 --> 00:37:34,704
Our true purpose is bridging

772
00:37:34,745 --> 00:37:37,465
traditional culture with modern life,

773
00:37:38,584 --> 00:37:41,704
making Neo-Chinese Style
with cultural resonance

774
00:37:42,024 --> 00:37:45,544
accessible to and appreciated
by broader audiences.

775
00:37:46,024 --> 00:37:46,825
We're creating

776
00:37:47,144 --> 00:37:50,265
a distinct cultural style.

777
00:37:51,985 --> 00:37:52,664
I understand

778
00:37:53,345 --> 00:37:55,425
this process may take time,

779
00:37:56,224 --> 00:37:58,865
but it is worth waiting for.

780
00:38:05,648 --> 00:38:06,345
So,

781
00:38:06,624 --> 00:38:08,544
with your clear positioning,

782
00:38:09,624 --> 00:38:10,905
you must maintain control

783
00:38:11,345 --> 00:38:12,945
firmly in your hands.

784
00:38:14,265 --> 00:38:15,345
Be the decision-maker,

785
00:38:16,184 --> 00:38:17,825
not the professional manager

786
00:38:18,265 --> 00:38:19,385
who works for investors.

787
00:38:25,104 --> 00:38:27,825
You're advising Ms. Xu
to avoid deep capital ties.

788
00:38:28,504 --> 00:38:31,785
But where will funding come from?

789
00:38:37,345 --> 00:38:38,064
Presales.

790
00:38:41,465 --> 00:38:42,704
IP Ecology Matrix.

791
00:38:44,584 --> 00:38:45,385
First, presales.

792
00:38:46,785 --> 00:38:48,345
The brand isn't established yet.

793
00:38:49,184 --> 00:38:52,104
So I suggest you focus on online sales.

794
00:38:53,144 --> 00:38:54,624
Generate cash flow via presales

795
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:56,624
and maintain liquidity.

796
00:38:57,465 --> 00:38:58,064
Remember.

797
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,945
Only financial independence

798
00:39:02,905 --> 00:39:05,104
guarantees that you retain control

799
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:06,224
over your company.

800
00:39:13,024 --> 00:39:14,104
IP Ecology.

801
00:39:15,064 --> 00:39:16,785
The essence of the internet today

802
00:39:17,664 --> 00:39:19,865
is standardization first,
and then personalization.

803
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,785
If you develop one or two hit products,

804
00:39:24,425 --> 00:39:26,465
you can expand with other SKUs.

805
00:39:26,504 --> 00:39:28,785
You could even create
your own derivative products.

806
00:39:29,345 --> 00:39:31,745
Then the complete

807
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:32,745
IP ecosystem

808
00:39:33,305 --> 00:39:34,504
keeps growing stronger.

809
00:39:35,704 --> 00:39:37,825
What you'll own is creativity

810
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:40,664
and design copyrights.

811
00:39:41,745 --> 00:39:43,064
With these assets,

812
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:44,985
you'll have better leverage

813
00:39:45,745 --> 00:39:46,985
when negotiating with investors

814
00:39:47,704 --> 00:39:48,825
to protect your interests

815
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,945
and maintain control.

816
00:39:59,584 --> 00:40:02,144
Building your own unique IP brand

817
00:40:04,104 --> 00:40:07,504
is the essence and core advantage

818
00:40:08,504 --> 00:40:09,345
of cultural products.

819
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:14,945
Am I right, Mr. Liang?

820
00:40:19,425 --> 00:40:20,425
I think

821
00:40:22,305 --> 00:40:23,865
there's some validity to your points.

822
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:26,064
Thank you.

823
00:40:34,945 --> 00:40:35,865
One final suggestion.

824
00:40:37,985 --> 00:40:39,184
Whether it's me,

825
00:40:39,865 --> 00:40:40,385
Ms. Jiang,

826
00:40:41,544 --> 00:40:42,825
or higher-level executives

827
00:40:42,825 --> 00:40:43,745
offering advice,

828
00:40:44,825 --> 00:40:45,785
listen to them

829
00:40:45,785 --> 00:40:47,224
but don't blindly accept them.

830
00:40:48,265 --> 00:40:49,184
Final decisions

831
00:40:50,184 --> 00:40:51,504
must come from your own judgment.

832
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:57,385
I see.

833
00:40:58,265 --> 00:40:59,024
Good.

834
00:41:15,624 --> 00:41:17,745
Thank you, Mr. Liang and Mr. Shen.

835
00:41:18,305 --> 00:41:19,624
I'll consider your advice.

836
00:41:19,825 --> 00:41:20,664
Thank you.

837
00:41:20,985 --> 00:41:24,945
Let's conclude the meeting here.

838
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:35,104
Well,

839
00:41:36,345 --> 00:41:37,865
I'll take my leave now.

840
00:41:38,024 --> 00:41:38,785
- Want a ride?
- Want a ride?

841
00:41:39,745 --> 00:41:41,385
I prefer walking these days.

842
00:41:42,624 --> 00:41:43,144
Mr. Liang.

843
00:41:43,504 --> 00:41:44,425
Please lock up for me.

844
00:41:44,425 --> 00:41:45,064
Okay.

845
00:41:57,104 --> 00:41:57,905
Shen Haoming.

846
00:41:58,945 --> 00:42:00,664
My fingerprint locks the door.

847
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,865
Please leave so I can lock up.

848
00:42:08,745 --> 00:42:09,265
Okay.

849
00:42:15,345 --> 00:42:16,624
Remember this business model.

850
00:42:24,905 --> 00:42:26,305
What nonsense.

851
00:42:39,465 --> 00:42:40,465
Why are you here?

852
00:42:41,544 --> 00:42:42,785
We agreed on a week.

853
00:42:44,825 --> 00:42:46,265
It's already Monday.

854
00:42:48,752 --> 00:42:49,320
Oh.

855
00:42:51,345 --> 00:42:52,184
May I come in?

856
00:43:08,304 --> 00:43:09,024
Have a seat.

857
00:43:09,985 --> 00:43:10,584
Me?

858
00:43:20,425 --> 00:43:21,305
These are for you.

859
00:43:25,064 --> 00:43:26,465
You practice on yourself

860
00:43:26,544 --> 00:43:28,385
for new makeup looks.

861
00:43:29,024 --> 00:43:29,945
But some cosmetics

862
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,425
may damage your skin.

863
00:43:33,504 --> 00:43:34,584
I've done my research.

864
00:43:35,024 --> 00:43:36,945
These are made with safe ingredients.

865
00:43:43,624 --> 00:43:46,584
Your dry skin is prone
to allergies in summer.

866
00:43:47,745 --> 00:43:49,064
This contains hyaluronic acid,

867
00:43:49,224 --> 00:43:49,825
aloe vera,

868
00:43:50,184 --> 00:43:51,024
and ceramides.

869
00:43:51,385 --> 00:43:53,704
It's great for hydration and soothing.

870
00:43:53,968 --> 00:43:54,584
Here.

871
00:43:58,385 --> 00:43:59,544
Your cool undertones

872
00:44:00,425 --> 00:44:01,385
suit pink

873
00:44:01,385 --> 00:44:02,425
and nude lipsticks.

874
00:44:03,465 --> 00:44:05,624
This is 928, Milky Sakura.

875
00:44:06,385 --> 00:44:08,104
This is 302, Nude Bean Paste.

876
00:44:08,624 --> 00:44:10,865
They give a fresh daily look.

877
00:44:14,785 --> 00:44:17,704
This is 396, Strawberry Red.

878
00:44:18,785 --> 00:44:20,345
That's your favorite fruit.

879
00:44:23,465 --> 00:44:25,825
And 564, Clear Peach Glow.

880
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,064
Low saturation, natural flush.

881
00:44:28,905 --> 00:44:29,520
Here.

882
00:44:33,664 --> 00:44:35,144
- And this...
- Okay.

883
00:44:35,425 --> 00:44:35,985
Enough.

884
00:44:38,265 --> 00:44:38,865
Thank you.

885
00:44:40,385 --> 00:44:41,024
But

886
00:44:41,825 --> 00:44:43,345
why did you suddenly decide

887
00:44:43,345 --> 00:44:44,385
to learn about these?

888
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,104
Because you like them.

889
00:44:51,745 --> 00:44:53,945
We'll have more topics
in common like this.

890
00:44:54,504 --> 00:44:55,584
You'll like me more.

891
00:44:57,865 --> 00:44:58,544
Lin.

892
00:45:01,504 --> 00:45:02,504
Have you decided?

893
00:45:08,144 --> 00:45:11,945
I gave you this whole week

894
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,024
to make up your mind.

895
00:45:14,305 --> 00:45:15,584
I've thought it through.

896
00:45:16,184 --> 00:45:17,584
I think all your concerns

897
00:45:18,064 --> 00:45:19,265
are unnecessary.

898
00:45:19,905 --> 00:45:21,544
I've never felt that our degrees

899
00:45:21,865 --> 00:45:23,865
or jobs put us on different levels.

900
00:45:24,425 --> 00:45:25,385
On the contrary,

901
00:45:26,144 --> 00:45:27,624
you came alone from your hometown,

902
00:45:28,345 --> 00:45:29,704
worked diligently from scratch,

903
00:45:30,224 --> 00:45:31,305
never belittled yourself,

904
00:45:31,624 --> 00:45:33,385
and strived to learn more.

905
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:35,584
I've always

906
00:45:37,584 --> 00:45:39,385
thought that you're shining.

907
00:45:44,865 --> 00:45:45,945
So I'm sure

908
00:45:47,024 --> 00:45:47,785
that I like you.

909
00:45:49,345 --> 00:45:51,064
I want to be with you.

910
00:45:53,024 --> 00:45:55,504
You're not proposing, are you?

911
00:45:57,144 --> 00:45:58,584
What kind of proposal is this?

912
00:45:58,745 --> 00:45:59,504
Can't you do it...

913
00:46:02,465 --> 00:46:03,825
Sorry, did I hurt you?

914
00:46:04,144 --> 00:46:05,024
Let me see.

915
00:46:06,465 --> 00:46:07,785
Anatomically speaking,

916
00:46:08,584 --> 00:46:10,224
it's around the left third, second,

917
00:46:10,985 --> 00:46:12,064
and first rib,

918
00:46:13,224 --> 00:46:14,785
and deeper in.

919
00:46:16,184 --> 00:46:16,785
What?

920
00:46:17,265 --> 00:46:17,785
Where?

921
00:46:19,024 --> 00:46:19,624
The heart.

922
00:46:21,064 --> 00:46:21,985
You scared me.

923
00:46:22,024 --> 00:46:23,504
I thought I actually hurt you.

924
00:46:25,144 --> 00:46:25,825
Annoying.

925
00:46:34,184 --> 00:46:35,345
But it doesn't hurt now.

926
00:46:36,664 --> 00:46:37,905
Because you're in there.

927
00:46:42,745 --> 00:46:45,584
Is this an orthopedic romance?

928
00:46:47,544 --> 00:46:49,184
Did I not express myself?

929
00:46:52,345 --> 00:46:52,945
Lin,

930
00:46:54,425 --> 00:46:56,024
though I'm just a doctor,

931
00:46:57,504 --> 00:46:59,664
I can support you in Jingzhou.

932
00:47:01,265 --> 00:47:03,064
Feel free to do whatever you want.

933
00:47:04,865 --> 00:47:05,785
Decide on

934
00:47:07,985 --> 00:47:08,785
the trial period.

935
00:47:16,064 --> 00:47:16,584
Then,

936
00:47:18,265 --> 00:47:19,305
when do you think...

937
00:47:20,865 --> 00:47:21,584
when do you think

938
00:47:22,584 --> 00:47:24,104
we should start counting from?
