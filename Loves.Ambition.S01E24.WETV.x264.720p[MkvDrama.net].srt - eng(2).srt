(Yan Studio)
Granny!

30
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,840
You're so happy today.

31
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,239
Got good news

32
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,999
to share with me?

33
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:01,120
Look at our outfits.

34
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:01,999
Pretty, right?

35
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,320
We made them ourselves.

36
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,999
Grandma, take a closer look.

37
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,439
Every stitch

38
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:10,040
is pure handwork.

39
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:10,959
You must know this.

40
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,519
Every single stitch represents
our intangible heritage.

41
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:14,200
Grandma.

42
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:15,280
- Look.
- The entire outfit.

43
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,880
Doesn't Lin look like a model?

44
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:17,799
Pretty, right?

45
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,519
Like a model, huh?

46
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:21,600
Let me show you Yan's outfit.

47
00:02:21,679 --> 00:02:22,440
Look at me.

48
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:24,600
- Is that pretty?
- You look great, really.

49
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,320
Let me get you closer.

50
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,160
Look at her.

51
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,959
Does she look like a businesswoman?

52
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,119
- What do you think?
- Absolutely!

53
00:02:31,119 --> 00:02:31,799
Look closer.

54
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:33,280
We made all of this ourselves.

55
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:34,000
Look.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,704
Gorgeous, right?

57
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:36,200
What do you think?

58
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:37,839
Lovely! So lovely!

59
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:39,600
When you wear this,

60
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,600
you just look like a little fairy!

61
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,720
Then you're the fairy queen!

62
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,440
- Right?
- Yes!

63
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,519
You're the most pretty,

64
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:47,760
the most lovely fairy queen!

65
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,920
By the way,

66
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:51,760
we made a custom set just for you.

67
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,000
We'll bring it to you.

68
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,040
If I wear clothes

69
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:56,679
made by you girls,

70
00:02:56,799 --> 00:02:59,440
then I'll "look cute"!

71
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:00,559
Grandma.

72
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,920
You've been on your phone a lot!

73
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,679
You even know "look cute" now.

74
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,799
But that's not popular anymore.

75
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,160
I am Yan Studio's

76
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,399
number one superfan!

77
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,320
You also know that?

78
00:03:15,408 --> 00:03:16,688
Watched many live streams too.

79
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:19,040
Alright.

80
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,399
Next time

81
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:22,679
when you take photos,

82
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:23,959
send me more, okay?

83
00:03:24,112 --> 00:03:24,839
Okay.

84
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,000
Got it.

85
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:26,959
Okay.

86
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,200
We'll hang up now.

87
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,839
Goodbye!

88
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,399
Bye!

89
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,239
Don't you feel so happy

90
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:34,280
after every call with her?

91
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,440
She's always smiling,

92
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,040
supporting, and encouraging us.

93
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,160
It's so nice.

94
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,040
And she always

95
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:47,720
picks up on the very first ring.

96
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:49,559
So

97
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,519
she is always waiting for us to call.

98
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:55,440
That's true.

99
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,440
I asked her to come to Jingzhou,

100
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,440
but she refused.

101
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,480
I can tell

102
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,280
she's afraid

103
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
she'll disturb our work

104
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,359
or add to our burden.

105
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:16,400
So...

106
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,040
Yan Studio must succeed.

107
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,559
We'll build

108
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:26,480
our own home in Jingzhou

109
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,400
so we can bring Grandma here

110
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:31,400
to live with us.

111
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,559
She can be at peace.

112
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,679
We can make it.

113
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,679
Careful, don't snag the fabric.

114
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,640
- Be careful.
- I'm being careful.

115
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,119
I'm even holding it.

116
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:48,799
Hurry up.

117
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,840
Take it off.

118
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,199
Watch the gauze.

119
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:52,112
Spread your arms out.

120
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,040
Like this?

121
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,712
Exactly.

122
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,319
Otherwise, it'll tear.

123
00:04:55,952 --> 00:04:58,416
This afternoon I'll go fetch the goods.
Call me if anything.

124
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,200
Hello?

125
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,239
Our truck broke down on the road.

126
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,080
What?

127
00:05:13,359 --> 00:05:14,480
Are you okay?

128
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,439
I'm fine.

129
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,999
But if this batch can't be
put in storage on time,

130
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:21,239
sale will be a mess later.

131
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:24,799
And we have to pay heavy late fees.

132
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,480
I called for help.

133
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,520
They'll arrive
after three to four hours.

134
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,040
So...

135
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,799
I sent you my location.

136
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,119
Send a truck here now.

137
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:32,920
Okay.

138
00:05:33,328 --> 00:05:33,960
Wait.

139
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,600
Should I ask Lin and Guan to go?

140
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,168
No need.

141
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,359
Stay at the office.

142
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,520
For emergencies.

143
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,119
Understood.

144
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:41,600
Take care of yourself.

145
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,239
Hurry up.

146
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:47,728
Yao.

147
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:49,400
Mr. Shen?

148
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,879
You look panicked.

149
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:51,879
Did something happen?

150
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,160
Yan's in trouble.

151
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,160
The truck broke down on the road.

152
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,720
You... Why are you here?

153
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,319
I'll move the goods. Get in the truck.

154
00:06:38,119 --> 00:06:38,799
I'll help you.

155
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:39,559
It's okay.

156
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:40,920
We can handle it.

157
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,879
Come here.

158
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:42,720
We'll finish soon.

159
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:43,319
Come on.

160
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,040
Be careful.

161
00:06:53,359 --> 00:06:53,999
We'll be quick.

162
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,040
Wait.

163
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:56,359
Hold this for me.

164
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:00,840

165
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,080

Have some water.

217
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,799
Thanks.

218
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,280
Want more?

219
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,319
No.

220
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,439
You have plenty of staff.

221
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:05,920
Why transport yourself?

222
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,839
It's our first batch.

223
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:11,839
I don't want any mishaps.

224
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,559
So

225
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:14,559
I came to check.

226
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,479
I need to check the next batch.

227
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,120
What about you?

228
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,079
Got such a huge company,

229
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,959
and you came yourself?

230
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:30,000
There's a company retreat.

231
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,920
I called Chen Lin,

232
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,160
but he's not answering.

233
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,079
So I came here myself.

234
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,240
You really don't need to refuse

235
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,439
my helping you.

236
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,400
In business world,

237
00:10:55,319 --> 00:10:56,760
no one succeeds

238
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:57,880
without help.

239
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,000
It's not like that.

240
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:05,640
I just want to prove to myself

241
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,199
that I can live the life I want

242
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:12,760
without relying on your resources.

243
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,959
So if you truly care about me,

244
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:20,920
don't make me lose that faith, okay?

245
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,479
But I drove for you

246
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,120
and helped you move goods.

247
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:28,920
That's not money power, right?

248
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,679
If you really mind it,

249
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,520
maybe give me a little reward.

250
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:45,719
Actually, I know why you're
working so hard now.

251
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,000
I used to be too arrogant.

252
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:54,360
I underestimated your value.

253
00:11:56,319 --> 00:11:57,520
But I truly hope

254
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,040
you can live more easily

255
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:02,599
and happily.

256
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:13,120
Now that I'm being true to myself,

257
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,079
I'm much happier than before.

258
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:21,079
Besides,

259
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,479
no job in this world isn't hard.

260
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,799
But if the outcome brings joy,

261
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:28,400
a little hardship doesn't matter.

262
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,640
You have me.

263
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:36,599
You don't understand.

264
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:37,880
What I want to say is

265
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,959
I want my happiness to come from myself.

266
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,040
I believe you will.

267
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,280
I will.

268
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,920
I definitely will.

269
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,760
Otherwise,

270
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,120
you wouldn't see me as I am now.

271
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,559
And I wouldn't see you
talking to me like this, either.

272
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,520
Keep it up.

273
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,040
By the way,

274
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,160
you don't have to target Jiang Liang

275
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,360
so aggressively.

276
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,479
I'm not targeting him.

277
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:31,520
He's the one who wants me gone.

278
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,360
But you both want
the best for Yan Studio, right?

279
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:41,040
Do you really believe his words?

280
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,040
What he said isn't all wrong.

281
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:49,640
But I chose your plan.

282
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,479
Smart choice.

283
00:13:58,199 --> 00:13:59,520
So I want to tell you,

284
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:01,240
Jiang Liang is now my investor.

285
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:04,000
Don't go head-to-head with him.

286
00:14:06,224 --> 00:14:06,920
Fine.

287
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,479
Sir, keep going.

288
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,360
I've reviewed the contract.

289
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,319
No issues.

290
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,400
Yan.

291
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,040
Once the goods arrive,
the warehouse will unload.

295
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,120
is sold out!

296
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,640
Post-sales statistics show

297
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,599
our return rate is extremely low.

298
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:57,360
Customer satisfaction rate

299
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,319

that our second batch is launching.

304
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:06,880
Five designs in total.

305
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,400
If sales go as smoothly

306
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,479
as the first,

307
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,360
we can start pre-orders online
for batch three.

308
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,160
Qiao Lin.

309
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,479
Tell the factory

310
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,920
to add another production line.

311
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:16,759
No problem.

312
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:17,679
Add it!

313
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:18,999
We are selling well!

314
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,040
By the way, Xiaowan.

315
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:23,479
Keep developing the online marketing.

316
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,439
We need proper warm-up
for the second batch.

317
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,959
Don't worry, Ms. Xu.

318
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:27,999
Ms. Xu.

319
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:30,320
Some beauty brands want
product placements in our videos.

320
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:32,439
Resource swaps are being finalized.

321
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,120
Good.

322
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,160
Keep with it.

323
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,039
Two of our first-batch designs
sold out fast.

324
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,960
Fans who missed out
are requesting a restocking.

325
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:41,479
Tally the numbers.

326
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,039
We'll purchase more fabric

327
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,640
and add the production.

328
00:17:44,848 --> 00:17:45,439
Okay.

329
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:46,920
Yao.

330
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,920
Are the designs
for the fourth batch ready?

331
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,160
I've sent the drawings
to the pattern makers of the factory.

332
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,519
Before starting production,

333
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,400
a few details need adjustment.

334
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,439
Tell me once it's done.

335
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:56,840
Okay.

336
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,080
Lastly, Meng Zhao.

337
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,479
Stay on after-sales,
and give feedback in time.

338
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,160
Got it, Ms. Xu.

339
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:01,959
Everyone.

340
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,279
We're now gearing up

341
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,640
for the second batch launch.

342
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,360
Keep the workflow tight.

343
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:09,320
Keep the momentum.

344
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:10,640
Let's go!

345
00:18:10,999 --> 00:18:11,840
Let's go!

346
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,679
Let's go!

We've got trouble!

00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,840
Why does it look exactly

373
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,160
like our second-batch pieces?

374
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:56,239
Yes. I found it on a shopping site,

375
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,679
saying it's from the same factory.

376
00:19:57,999 --> 00:19:59,279
They look the same.

377
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:01,320
But look closely,
the fabrics are totally different.

378
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,479
You noticed it, right?

379
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,439
They are machine-made,

380
00:20:04,719 --> 00:20:05,999
but our products are handmade.

381
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:08,160
We price at 3,999 yuan.

00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:09,840
They sell at 399 yuan.

383
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,999
Within just one day,

384
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:11,999
they've sold hundreds.

385
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,439
We only released 100 units total.

386
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,840
This one's even cheaper.

387
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,199
Only costs 199 yuan.

388
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:19,519
What's the feedback?

389
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,439
Some influencer made a hit piece,
smearing us.

390
00:20:21,439 --> 00:20:22,199
A popular one.

391
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:22,840
(Hi, everyone.)

392
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,080
(To be honest,)

393
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,039
(I consider myself)

394
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,640
(half a fan of Yan Studio.)

395
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,880
(I'm excited.)

396
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:28,840
(I believe)

397
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,840
(their 3,999 piece must be better)

398
00:20:30,999 --> 00:20:31,840
(than the 399 one)

399
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,880
(I bought online.)

400
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:34,999
(Okay, now,)

401
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:36,880
(I'll do an unboxing video.)

402
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,519
Similar posts and videos

403
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:41,120
have appeared online.

404
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:43,519
What's with this blurry footage?

405
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,959
Deliberately blur the details.

406
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:47,120
Our actual products won't be
of such poor texture.

407
00:20:47,239 --> 00:20:48,959
They are misleading.

408
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,120
There are two possibilities.

409
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,759
Either our designs
got leaked by the factory.

410
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:55,800
Or someone wants to
deliberately smear us.

411
00:20:56,439 --> 00:20:57,560
Guan has gone to the factory

412
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,560
to investigate.

413
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,840
How are the sales?

414
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,080
Zero orders.

415
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,840
Even worse,

416
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,439
many people are canceling orders.

417
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:07,199
First-batch buyers want returns.
Some even won't return the goods.

418
00:21:07,439 --> 00:21:08,640
Likely got influenced

419
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,719
by those bad reviews.

420
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,920
Now our mini-program store

421
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,880
and video channels are
flooded with bad ratings.

422
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:14,600
Ms. Xu.

423
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:16,400
We went to the factory.

424
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:17,968
The designs weren't leaked by them.

425
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,200
Seeing the bad reviews online,
they're worried about the final payment.

426
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,199
For the third batch,

427
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:24,279
they demand an extra
30% deposit before production.

428
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:25,519
Ms. Xu, what should we do?

429
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,679
(Look at its pattern and fabric)

430
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,679
(of the 3,999 piece.)

431
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:40,439
(And of the 399 yuan piece.)

432
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,080
(Look at their knot buttons)

433
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,160
(and technique used.)

434
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:44,120
(See?)

435
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,759
(Do you see?)

436
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,600
(They're identical.)

437
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,479
(And the patterns,)

438
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,920
(the texture,)

439
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:50,679
(and the fabric quality.)

440
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,160
(They're exactly the same!)

441
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,239
(Guys.)

442
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:56,519
(I'm furious.)

443
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:57,600
(Who can stand this?)

444
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,999
(No conscience at all!)

445
00:21:58,999 --> 00:21:59,640
You're here.

446
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:00,479
Good.

447
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,800
What's up?

448
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:05,800
Yan Studio you invested in

449
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,160
is drowning in public criticism.

450
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:08,959
And you're still so calm?

451
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,640
Prices inflated tenfold.

452
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,920
Tricking customers.

453
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:15,679
Even Yuanhang is dragged into this.

454
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,719
Terminate the investment right away.

455
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:22,360
Calm down.

456
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:25,560
Are you still that
unflappable Ms. Jiang?

457
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:30,519
When big influencers exposing scams,

458
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,479
consumers will lose their sanity easily.

459
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,600
Once the heat fades,

460
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,840
who will care about the truth?

461
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,479
Yan Studio will be worthless.

462
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,759
Cease collaboration with Yan Studio.

463
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,560
Cut your losses.

464
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:54,800
Don't worry.

465
00:22:55,239 --> 00:22:56,239
Unexpected issues

466
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:58,320
always appear in business.

467
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,039
I'll always stand by you

468
00:23:01,439 --> 00:23:02,479
and help you.

469
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:03,536
Okay?

470
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,400
I just feel sorry.

471
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:13,120
When Yan Studio started with nothing,

472
00:23:14,239 --> 00:23:15,759
when no one believed in us,

473
00:23:17,999 --> 00:23:18,999
you supported us.

474
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:22,560
You invested and got us started.

475
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:24,439
Really, thank you.

476
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:27,640
So, now,

477
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,920
with this crisis,

478
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:32,920
I won't dodge responsibility.

479
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:36,160
Why?

480
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,239
Don't be so gloomy.

481
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:39,279
I'm here eating,

482
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:40,560
not blaming.

483
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,039
You might face refunds, returns,

484
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,600
and production issues.

485
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,600
So what?

486
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,080
I've got funds ready.

487
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,759
Cover the deficit first.

488
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,640
I just got Yuanhang's email.

489
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:07,160
To terminate investment in Yan Studio.

490
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,039
The investment account is frozen too.

491
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,479
- So, Jiang Liang...
- Don't worry.

492
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:17,279
That's the procedure.

493
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,560
I can use my private funds.

494
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,600
Rest assured.

495
00:24:25,239 --> 00:24:26,920
I will help you.

496
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,120
Thank you.

497
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:31,759
No need.

498
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:34,519
Really, thank you.

499
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,320
Don't mention it.

500
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,719
You're willing to help at this moment.

501
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,519
But...

502
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,320
The more you offer,

503
00:24:46,896 --> 00:24:48,368
the more I feel I shouldn't accept.

504
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,439
Don't overthink it.

505
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:56,239
Yuanhang Group
has already made the decision.

506
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,600
As high-rise,

507
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,160
you can't go against its stance.

508
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:04,720
I won't

509
00:25:06,352 --> 00:25:07,959
drag you down

510
00:25:07,959 --> 00:25:10,400
just to survive.

511
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,320
We're friends,

512
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:19,400
but this is business.

513
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:23,519
They're separate matters.

514
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,039
Besides,

515
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:35,519
about your suggestion,

516
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:36,800
I thought it over.

517
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,479
Actually, Shen Haoming was right.

518
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,759
At this stage,

519
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:45,920
Yan Studio shouldn't tie
ourselves to capital.

520
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,039
We should focus on

521
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,360
building our own IP matrix.

522
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:52,199
I admit

523
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:56,320
regarding Yan Studio's development,

524
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,160
his proposal was slightly better.

525
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,759
But I think this crisis

526
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
is not totally bad.

527
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,320
At least I know

528
00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:22,239
I've got you, such a great investor,

529
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,479
such a loyal friend.

530
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,800
If that's the case,

531
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,800
I won't push.

532
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,199
I respect your decision,

533
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:42,160
and Yuanhang's decision too.

534
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:47,759
The investment funds
are just frozen for now.

535
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,959
After the crisis passes,

536
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:51,160
I'll convince my sister.

537
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:54,759
The investor spot must still be mine.

538
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:55,959
No problem.

539
00:26:56,479 --> 00:26:57,039
You promise?

540
00:26:57,239 --> 00:26:57,840
I promise.

541
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,080
Additionally,

542
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,320
let me handle public relations.

543
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,199
My network's wider.

544
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:05,560
Thanks.

545
00:27:18,999 --> 00:27:20,120
Actually, I quite envy you.

546
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,479
Envy me for what?

547
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,959
For having a great investor

548
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:29,080
who's got your back,

549
00:27:29,479 --> 00:27:32,719
also an extraordinary friend like me.

550
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,239
How did you get so lucky?

551
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,320
Because I'm outstanding enough

552
00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:40,880
to attract a great investor.

553
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:42,039
Like attracts like.

554
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,360
Right.

555
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,759
Honestly,

556
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:57,959
you are the strongest girl
I've ever met.

557
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,439
Okay.

558
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,999
I'm serious.

559
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:09,160
I believe you.

560
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,256
Everyone.

561
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,600
Cheer up.

562
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,600
We must face challenges head-on.

563
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,360
Every fashion brand

564
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,400
encounters these issues.

565
00:28:31,199 --> 00:28:32,160
Nothing is impossible.

566
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:33,719
Results come from action.

567
00:28:36,144 --> 00:28:36,719
Okay.

568
00:28:36,959 --> 00:28:37,679
All departments,

569
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:38,959
report your current issues

570
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,039
for discussion, okay?

571
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,880
About the no-reason refund requests,

572
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,479
what to do?

573
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,800
If the clothes were bought

574
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,160
through official channels,

575
00:28:46,439 --> 00:28:47,400
refund them all.

576
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,600
We'll cover shipping.

577
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,519
Any pressure on finance?

578
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:51,640
Unconditionally?

579
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,479
The first batch's sales loss
will be huge.

580
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:55,679
Moreover,

581
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,560
the PR manager of the beauty brand
that reached us

582
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,840
wants to pause collaboration.

583
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,199
Do as they requested.

584
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,199
It's our brand's fault this time.

585
00:29:07,719 --> 00:29:08,920
Comfort customers

586
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,039
and stay in touch.

587
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,400
Got it, Ms. Xu.

588
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,400
Huanhuan.

589
00:29:15,999 --> 00:29:18,160
Pin the after-sales policy

590
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:19,400
to the top of our store page.

591
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,800
Don't delete comments,
but explain clearly.

592
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,199
Take all questions and criticisms.

593
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:29,120
For counterfeit shops online,

594
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,199
report them all

595
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,519
and get them taken down fast.

596
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,759
Got it, Yan.

597
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:38,880
Yao.

598
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,360
There's a problem
with the second batch of designs.

599
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,320
But we can't hold anyone
accountable now.

600
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:46,479
Qiao Lin told me

601
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:48,120
the third batch hasn't started.

602
00:29:48,479 --> 00:29:52,160
Can you fix the draft quickly?

603
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:54,640
Keep your originals safe.

604
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,160
Can you do it?

605
00:29:56,439 --> 00:29:56,959
Yes.

606
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,880
Of course I can.

607
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:01,560
Yan.

608
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,239
Our funds are extremely tight now.

609
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:05,719
Should we delay the third batch?

610
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:06,560
Exactly.

611
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,999
Don't forget the factory wants

612
00:30:07,999 --> 00:30:09,920
30% more deposit before production.

613
00:30:09,999 --> 00:30:10,719
Then pay it.

614
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,039
After Yao finalizes the designs,

615
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,400
start production.

616
00:30:19,344 --> 00:30:21,978
(Disappointing! Regret buying.
Overpriced trash! Yan Studio's doomed.)

617
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,479
Huanhuan.

618
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:26,279
How's our online reputation?

619
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,600
It's a complete mess.

620
00:30:28,624 --> 00:30:29,360
Alright.

621
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,400
Ms. Xu.

622
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,600
Ms. Xu!

623
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,199
Mr. Zhang.

624
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:37,880
Ms. Qiao.

625
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,759
Where's Ms. Xu?

626
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:41,360
She isn't here today.

627
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,199
Any problem? Let's talk inside.

628
00:30:43,199 --> 00:30:43,840
No, no.

629
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,904
Ms. Qiao.

630
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:46,560
Well,

631
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,160
I've supplied your trims

632
00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:49,719
for a long time.

633
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,840
Never made any mistakes, right?

634
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,039
So,

635
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:53,999
let's cut the chase.

636
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,959
I'm here today for one thing.

637
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:58,120
Please settle the payment now.

638
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:00,439
Mr. Zhang.

639
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,600
The contract said
settlement's at month-end.

640
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:04,160
It's still more than ten days away.

641
00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:06,239
You can't just show up now

642
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,880
asking for money.

643
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,120
That's not it.

644
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:12,840
Those fakes are everywhere.

645
00:31:13,199 --> 00:31:15,320
Your second batch
didn't sell at all, right?

646
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:18,320
I'm afraid by month-end,

647
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:20,439
your office will be empty.

648
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:22,479
If this debt dies,

649
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:24,759
I'm done too. Understand?

650
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:25,640
Mr. Zhang.

651
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:27,039
We're just having

652
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,279
a small setback.

653
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:29,640
Business is running fine.

654
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,999
We won't escape.

655
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,039
If you insist on settling today,

656
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,439
you'll be breaching the contract.

657
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:35,999
Then we'd have the right

658
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:36,959
to demand compensation.

659
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:38,239
Come on.

660
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,519
Don't threaten me with compensation.

661
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,439
Your business is failing.

662
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,840
If you collapse,

663
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,039
I'm not dying with you!

664
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,320
- What are you talking about?
- Watch your mouth.

665
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:48,920
Nonsense!

666
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,080
What did you say?

667
00:31:50,719 --> 00:31:52,160
You're trying

668
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:53,479
to bully me, huh?

669
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:55,199
Let me tell you.

670
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,239
My factory may be small,

671
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,479
but we're not pushovers.

672
00:31:58,519 --> 00:31:59,039
Qiao Lin.

673
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,999
If you don't settle the payment today,

674
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:03,400
think carefully about the consequences!

675
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:04,400
Consequences?

676
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,199
Are you threatening us now?

677
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:08,039
You came demanding money early.

678
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:09,080
How dare you yell here?

679
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,759
Exactly!

680
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,479
Exactly!

681
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,039
Mr. Zhang.

682
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,880
Our cooperation lasts a long time.

683
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:15,239
What you're doing now

684
00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:17,039
is kicking us while we're down.

685
00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:17,920
Well then,

686
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,120
I'll be straightforward.

687
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:20,999
You're not getting paid today.

688
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,519
We'll follow the contract.

689
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,920
Stop causing trouble.

690
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,600
Please leave.

691
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,600
Get out now.

692
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:27,840
Or we'll call the police!

693
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,479
You...

694
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,640
Are you leaving or not?

695
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,479
Watch it!

696
00:32:30,479 --> 00:32:30,999
Get out!

697
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:31,800
Please leave.

698
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,160
Go.

699
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,800
So this is your attitude?

700
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,640
Remember.

701
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,479
You'll regret it.

702
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,719
Just wait and see!

703
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,999
Watch your own step!

704
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:45,959
Lin.

705
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,400
Should we tell Yan about this?

706
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,519
No.

707
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,880
She's being grilled
by the e-commerce platform today.

708
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,400
She's got enough on her plate.

709
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,600
Let's just work.

710
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:57,880
Back to work.

711
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,279
I know.

712
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,640
About the online mess,

713
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:04,920
I'll handle it properly.

714
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:06,519
As stated in the meeting,

715
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,400
if there are any issues,

716
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,360
Yan Studio will bear all consequences.

717
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,320
Don't worry.

718
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:11,959
Ms. Xu.

719
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:16,279
Thank you.

720
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,840
Long time no see.

721
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:24,840
Ms. Xu.

722
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,320
Using traditional crafts

723
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,719
as a brand feature

724
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:31,439
really gives your brand taste.

725
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:34,679
Your development pace is impressive.

726
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,800
Congratulations.

727
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:39,120
Thank you.

728
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,640
But I heard

729
00:33:41,439 --> 00:33:42,880
before the second launch,

730
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,080
you ran into trouble.

731
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:52,519
I feel indignant for you.

732
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,999
Your hard work gets criticized,

733
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,160
while cheap fakes get praise.

734
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:02,400
That's unfair.

735
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:07,239
If stock piles up,

736
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,800
capital chains break,

737
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,039
investors pull out...

738
00:34:11,439 --> 00:34:12,159
Soon,

739
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,400
suppliers will come demanding payments.

740
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,439
How will you handle that?

741
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,280
Honestly,

742
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,999
I don't think this issue that simple.

743
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:30,320
It's hard to push a startup brand

744
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,880
into this position overnight.

745
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,840
I believe someone's behind it.

746
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,639
Think carefully.

747
00:34:37,959 --> 00:34:39,320
Did you offend anyone?

748
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,959
Is it a kind reminder

749
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,880
or a warning?

750
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,479
You know so much about those fakes.

751
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,159
Were you involved?

752
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:04,240
Is that why you're here?

753
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:08,720
Ms. Xu.

754
00:35:09,439 --> 00:35:10,559
Don't make baseless claims.

755
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:13,920
I'm a fan of yours,
so I care about your situations.

756
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:15,599
Don't wrong me.

757
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:18,256
Of course,

758
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,519
I do care whether it's Jinda or Situo

759
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,920
will win the deal with the Russians.

760
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,840
Help me,

761
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:31,360
and I'll help you.

762
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,360
How?

763
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:39,920
My proposal at the resort still stands.

764
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,119
If you can publicly announce

765
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,599
you and Mr. Shen are filing for divorce,

766
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,760
I'll solve your urgent problem.

767
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,720
5 million to your account

768
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,400
within an hour.

769
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,559
Not interested.

770
00:36:02,959 --> 00:36:03,760
Is it too little?

771
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:05,880
Ten million.

772
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:13,479
Twenty million.

773
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,519
That generous?

774
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,400
Aren't you afraid I'll demand more?

775
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,240
This is the price

776
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,760
for you to betray Mr. Shen.

777
00:36:29,999 --> 00:36:31,320
It's worth it.

778
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:32,639
I don't think so.

779
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,559
Why would I abandon

780
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:37,039
Jinda Group's support

781
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:38,920
for your mere 20 million?

782
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:40,680
Ms. Xu.

783
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,599
Don't be so stubborn.

784
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,079
Aren't you afraid your trouble

785
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:47,039
might spiral out of control?

786
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,039
I believe this won't be
my first trouble,

787
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,680
nor will it be the last.

788
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,880
Right, Mr. Steve?

789
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,240
Ms. Xu.

790
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,639
You're young,

791
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:05,760
beautiful,

792
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,599
decisive and fearless.

793
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,920
However,

794
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,639
overconfidence will bring you trouble.

795
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:15,559
You're right.

796
00:37:17,439 --> 00:37:18,159
I'll keep that.

797
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,880
If there's nothing else,

798
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,400
I need to get back to work.

799
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,599
You can refuse me.

800
00:37:29,439 --> 00:37:32,559
I will give you time to think.

801
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:35,280
If you change your mind, come find me.

802
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,959
Many problems really can't be solved

803
00:37:39,959 --> 00:37:40,920
without money.

804
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,400
Good day.

805
00:37:49,816 --> 00:37:51,568
(Review Cat: Yan Studio overprices,
betraying fans' trust)

806
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:53,222
(Boycott Yan Studio)

807
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:58,880
Mr. Shen.

808
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:01,200
This is the Q2 report.

809
00:38:04,632 --> 00:38:05,990
(The worst clothes I've ever bought)

810
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,400
Steve went to Yan Studio today.

811
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,400
Mr. Shen.

812
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:15,079
Should we help Yan?

813
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:16,999
Help?

814
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:19,240
She won't accept it.

815
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,680
I'll call you back later.

816
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:36,760
You're so busy.

817
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,920
I have something to discuss with you.

818
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:41,680
Is anything wrong?

819
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:42,680
No.

820
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,720
I'm here to submit my resignation.

821
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,400
Now?

822
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,599
Let me be frank.

823
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:55,720
I've found a great job.

824
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,039
The title and salary are perfect.

825
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,880
I'm not coming tomorrow.

826
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:05,680
Dong.

827
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:08,320
You're our CFO.

828
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:12,680
You handle all the accounts.

829
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,360
Yes.

830
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,200
Also, the communication with suppliers.

831
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,479
If you leave tomorrow,

832
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:19,720
who can take over?

833
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,559
Ms. Xu.

834
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,240
I'm really sorry.

835
00:39:24,999 --> 00:39:26,959
But this opportunity matters too much.

836
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,079
They require me to start right away
or they'll choose someone else.

837
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:32,280
You know how hard

838
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,320
good jobs are to get.

839
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,559
I don't want to miss this chance.

840
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:44,360
Do you have any demand

841
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:47,559
about the current salary?

842
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,320
Ms. Xu.

843
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,959
I know our books better than anyone.

844
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,920
What's the point of asking?

845
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:59,639
With the remaining funds,

846
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:00,920
our company

847
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:02,400
can't even last a month.

848
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,464
Please don't make things hard.

849
00:40:04,959 --> 00:40:05,880
We all know the things.

850
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:06,999
Just let me go.

851
00:40:06,999 --> 00:40:07,920
I can let you go.

852
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,479
No problem.

853
00:40:10,999 --> 00:40:14,119
But the labor contract states clearly.

854
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:16,400
Financial positions are special.

855
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,400
Resignation requires one month's notice.

856
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,159
Finish the handover,

857
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,999
and then you can leave.

858
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,559
Understood?

859
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,400
Lin Tao?

860
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:31,559
Lin.

861
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,999
Why are you here?

862
00:40:36,656 --> 00:40:37,904
Before going back to hometown,

863
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,760
I brought some stuff for you and Yan.

864
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:42,360
I made a scene at her workplace

865
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,320
but didn't apologize.

866
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:46,760
Now that I'm leaving Jingzhou,

867
00:40:46,999 --> 00:40:48,119
I wanted to settle this.

868
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:49,959
Otherwise, I'd feel guilty.

869
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,360
Yan isn't that petty.

870
00:40:52,439 --> 00:40:53,479
She's long forgotten.

871
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,479
Well, Ms. Xu.

872
00:40:54,479 --> 00:40:55,999
Don't go too far.

873
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,200
You only care about your company.

874
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,159
Have you thought how others live?

875
00:41:01,479 --> 00:41:03,999
You want me to stay
till your company shuts down?

876
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:05,880
At that time,

877
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:08,039
with a blemished resume,

878
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,599
how can I find a job?

879
00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:12,720
I know labor laws!

880
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,200
I'll pay the penalty.

881
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:15,888
Well,

882
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,159
wait a moment.

883
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,079
Who are you?

884
00:41:19,312 --> 00:41:20,079
Well,

885
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:21,760
it doesn't matter.

886
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,039
I heard what you just said.

887
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,920
As CFO,

888
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,599
you must complete

889
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,159
handover procedures before leaving.

890
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,159
You must ensure financial operations'
continuity and stability.

891
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:35,079
Resigning without handover

892
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:37,079
may violate financial discipline

893
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:37,999
and accounting rules.

894
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,400
It's illegal.

895
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,119
You know that, right?

896
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:42,840
Fine.

897
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,519
I'll hand over this mess.

898
00:41:45,999 --> 00:41:46,720
You dare take it?

899
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:48,999
Why not?

900
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,240
But don't think leaving

901
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:53,320
clears you of responsibility.

902
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,559
You must ensure all transferred ledgers,

903
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:58,360
reports, and related documents

904
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,639
are complete and error-free.

905
00:42:00,959 --> 00:42:04,599
Guarantee the legality and authenticity.

906
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,240
You're legally liable.

907
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:08,880
If you don't mind me
informing your next boss,

908
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,720
then fine.

909
00:42:15,999 --> 00:42:16,680
Okay.

910
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,720
I'll do the handover.

911
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,039
But let me make it clear.

912
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,519
My time is limited.

913
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,119
I'm giving you just two days.

914
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:24,079
Ms. Xu.

915
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:25,720
Find someone experienced

916
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,119
to take over.

917
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,920
I won't wait long.

918
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:29,840
What a coincidence.

919
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,840
I'm Bachelor in accounting,

920
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,680
Master in finance,

921
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:36,200
and certified accountant.

922
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,800
You've messed
with the wrong person this time.

923
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,439
Let's start now.

924
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:42,320
If there's a single slip,

925
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:43,360
you're not leaving.

926
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:51,720
Ms. Xu.

927
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,456
Ms. Qiao.

928
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:54,599
If you trust me,

929
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:56,599
let me handle the financial handover.

930
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:01,920
Alright.

931
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,760
The office's on the second floor.

932
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:05,840
Thank you.

933
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:07,959
Thanks, Lin Tao.

934
00:43:07,999 --> 00:43:08,559
No problem.

935
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:12,959
Why is he here?

936
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:15,959
He said he did something improper,

937
00:43:15,959 --> 00:43:17,159
so he came to apologize.

938
00:43:18,479 --> 00:43:18,999
That's all?

939
00:43:51,999 --> 00:43:52,559
Yao.

940
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,479
Have the journals and ledgers
been sorted out?

941
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:56,959
Yes.

942
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,360
Here.

943
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:00,800
Thank you.

944
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:04,912
Ms. Qiao.

945
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,240
Ms. Qiao.

946
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,920
I made you instant noodles.

947
00:44:08,439 --> 00:44:09,040
Thanks.

948
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,640
How much is left?

949
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,872
When the journals and ledgers all done,
I'll go over it again.

950
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,720
Go home now.

951
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,519
Do it tomorrow.

952
00:44:17,439 --> 00:44:17,999
It's okay.

953
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,039
The books are a mess now.

954
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:22,959
He's in such a rush to quit,

955
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,360
even willing to pay.

956
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,039
Maybe something's fishy.

957
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:28,360
Better to clear it up fast.

958
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,639
By the way,

959
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:34,159
there's something you and Xu Yan

960
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,280
should be aware of.

961
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,920
There is all outflow,

962
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,200
no income this month.

963
00:44:39,479 --> 00:44:41,999
I think one month later...

964
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,159
Alright, I see.

965
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,880
Thank you for your help this time.

966
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:50,680
No need.

967
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,360
We're all working outside.

968
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,720
Call me if you need anything.

969
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:54,512
Okay.

970
00:44:54,512 --> 00:44:55,120
Keep it up.

971
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:55,840
I'm leaving.

972
00:44:55,999 --> 00:44:56,528
Alright.

973
00:44:59,959 --> 00:45:00,639
Mrs. Baraikin.

974
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:02,320
Satisfied with this room?

975
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:04,039
Yes.

976
00:45:04,479 --> 00:45:06,280
Mr. Shen, you're so considerate.

977
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,360
Have a seat.

978
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,048
Alright.

979
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,079
Mr. Baraikin and I
feel like old friends.

980
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,880
We agreed if you came to Jingzhou,

981
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:16,439
I'd treat you well.

982
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,240
Indeed. Today, he was supposed to come

983
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,720
but got assigned other tasks

984
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,280
after landing.

985
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,400
That's okay.

986
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:26,680
I'll adjust my schedule for him.

987
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,400
By the way, Yan truly misses you.

988
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,400
Where is she?

989
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,479
I planned to bring her here,

990
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,360
but her company ran into some troubles.

991
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,880
So I didn't bring her.

992
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:40,400
What troubles?

993
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,840
Can I help?

994
00:45:41,959 --> 00:45:43,920
Inform Huanhuan and Meng Zhao.

995
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,840
The online buzz needs control.

996
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:46,480
Of course.

997
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,360
Ms. Xu.

998
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,280
I've been waiting for you.

999
00:45:49,999 --> 00:45:50,880
Mr. Liu.

1000
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:52,720
Mr. Zhang.

1001
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:53,720
Mr. Zhao.

1002
00:45:54,479 --> 00:45:55,479
What brings you here?

1003
00:45:56,039 --> 00:45:56,599
Ms. Xu.

1004
00:45:57,439 --> 00:45:58,439
Last time when I came,

1005
00:45:58,639 --> 00:45:59,320
you weren't here.

1006
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,680
Then what?

1007
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:01,760
Your colleague,

1008
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:04,320
Ms. Qiao chased me away.

1009
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,999
It wasn't the due date,
but they came for payment.

1010
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:09,639
Let's have some good tea and talk, okay?

1011
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,559
This way.

1012
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,160
Prepare some great tea.

1013
00:46:19,999 --> 00:46:20,760
Ms. Xu.

1014
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,039
Last time, Mr. Zhang
came to collect payment,

1015
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:26,439
but your young staff scolded him away.

1016
00:46:28,439 --> 00:46:29,119
Rest assured.

1017
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,400
we're not here

1018
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:31,479
to cause trouble today.

1019
00:46:31,639 --> 00:46:32,159
Look.

1020
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:32,880
Today,

1021
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,079
the production team,

1022
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,559
material suppliers,

1023
00:46:35,999 --> 00:46:37,439
and logistics partners are all here.

1024
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,479
We just want to ask

1025
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,360
will you still produce the third batch

1026
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,959
as plan?

1027
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,360
Of course we will.

1028
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:47,360
Mr. Zhang.

1029
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,840
I'm sorry

1030
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,999
about last time.

1031
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,360
We've had a lot on our plate.

1032
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,039
We've completed the revised designs

1033
00:46:56,039 --> 00:46:56,800
for that batch.

1034
00:46:57,079 --> 00:46:58,360
We're re-sampling

1035
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,280
and redoing the packaging.

1036
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,240
I see.

1037
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:04,479
Well,

1038
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:05,936
okay.

1039
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:07,999
But we have one condition.

1040
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:09,519
For the three sectors

1041
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:11,519
we are handling,

1042
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,840
the deposit goes up by 10%.

1043
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,920
Right.

1044
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:28,760
Alright.

1045
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:30,320
No problem.

1046
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:32,920
See?

1047
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,920
She's got funds.

1048
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:36,639
Ms. Xu.

1049
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,519
We know you're married

1050
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:40,079
to Mr. Shen from Jinda Group.

1051
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:42,920
This is pocket change to you.

1052
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:44,959
We're small business owners.

1053
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:46,079
We can't afford delays.

1054
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,439
So...

1055
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:49,599
If you want to keep working with us,

1056
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,200
pay the final payment

1057
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,639
for the second batch too.

1058
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,039
Mr. Liu.

1059
00:47:56,439 --> 00:47:57,840
The second batch

1060
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,680
isn't due yet.

1061
00:48:00,439 --> 00:48:04,400
Now our sales have been rough.

1062
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,880
Funds are currently tight.

1063
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,400
Then...

1064
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:11,999
Ask your husband.

1065
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,320
This is nothing

1066
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:15,880
for Jinda Group.

1067
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,360
My company has nothing to do
with Jinda Group.

1068
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:28,559
Ms. Xu.

1069
00:48:29,479 --> 00:48:30,559
We're all businesspeople.

1070
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,760
Business is business.

1071
00:48:32,959 --> 00:48:34,280
Given the situation now,

1072
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,999
we can't trust you.

1073
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,439
No payment today,

1074
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:40,639
we'll terminate the contract.

1075
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:43,039
That's true.

1076
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:44,079
See? I've told you!

1077
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,559
They're broke!

1078
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,240
Xu Yan,

1079
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,559
all your assets

1080
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,039
are frozen, right?

1081
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,320
Who told you that?

1082
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,920
Don't spread rumors, okay?

1083
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,200
Me? Spreading rumors?

1084
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,840
Everyone has heard.

1085
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,360
Go ask anyone.

1086
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:01,880
Exactly.

1087
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,280
Empty words won't work.

1088
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,079
We want money.

1089
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:07,200
You can't even pay the final payment

1090
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,400
but claim you're fine?

1091
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:09,479
Who'd believe that?

1092
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:10,760
Ms. Xu.

1093
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:12,200
I have only one request.

1094
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:15,999
Show us what you've got right now.

1095
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,800
And we'll let it go.

1096
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,680
No problem.

1097
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:20,599
But I have one condition.

1098
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,639
Once you receive the payment,

1099
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,240
Yan Studio will permanently
cease cooperation with you.
