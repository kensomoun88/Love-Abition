Sorry!

Hit me!

It's all my fault.

Go away!

Let go!

Let go!

Let go!

Let go!

42
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,161
Actually, I have one more merit.

43
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:05,881
I'm a sincere person,

44
00:02:06,122 --> 00:02:07,682
especially to relationships.

45
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,481
If one gives me a favor,

46
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,122
I'll repay him tenfold.

47
00:02:11,242 --> 00:02:12,282
- Mr. Liang.
- I...

48
00:02:12,522 --> 00:02:13,641
You really have many merits.

49
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:15,161
I'm home.

50
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:16,242
Go to bed early.

51
00:02:16,282 --> 00:02:16,802
Thank you.

52
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:17,641
Xu Yan.

53
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:19,522
I really enjoy

54
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:20,802
spending time alone with you.

55
00:02:21,522 --> 00:02:23,122
This feeling is unprecedented.

56
00:02:26,802 --> 00:02:29,641
Yuanhang has many projects,

57
00:02:30,682 --> 00:02:33,041
yet you still put effort in Yan Studio.

58
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,321
I really appreciate it.

59
00:02:35,962 --> 00:02:37,402
So I want to find an opportunity

60
00:02:37,402 --> 00:02:38,562
to express my gratitude.

61
00:02:39,402 --> 00:02:40,362
Today,

62
00:02:40,362 --> 00:02:41,402
I can let you feel relaxed

63
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:42,721
despite your busy schedule.

64
00:02:43,402 --> 00:02:44,362
It makes me happy too.

65
00:02:47,002 --> 00:02:48,161
In that case,

66
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:50,082
we can only talk

67
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:51,201
about work in the future?

68
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:51,881
Exactly.

69
00:03:03,282 --> 00:03:04,201
Don't be alert.

70
00:03:04,842 --> 00:03:06,201
I'm truly single.

71
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:09,481
But I'm still married.

72
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:16,002
But I think

73
00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:17,962
there's a huge problem

74
00:03:18,242 --> 00:03:19,441
between you and Shen Haoming.

75
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:21,362
You're aware of this too.

76
00:03:23,601 --> 00:03:24,641
Between him and me,

77
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:26,282
there is indeed a problem to resolve.

78
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:27,761
But that doesn't mean

79
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:29,562
I can accept another man.

80
00:03:31,321 --> 00:03:31,842
Mr. Liang.

81
00:03:33,242 --> 00:03:34,441
Thank you

82
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:36,522
for sharing
your cinematic world with me.

83
00:03:37,321 --> 00:03:38,402
I can tell

84
00:03:38,402 --> 00:03:41,481
you're someone really romantic,

85
00:03:43,282 --> 00:03:45,082
and never lonely.

86
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,122
But in my mind,

87
00:03:49,282 --> 00:03:50,802
you're an excellent investor.

88
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:53,881
I don't want

89
00:03:54,002 --> 00:03:55,881
any emotional entanglement

90
00:03:55,881 --> 00:03:57,481
to affect our current

91
00:03:57,481 --> 00:03:58,962
professional partnership.

92
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:00,002
What do you think?

93
00:04:00,842 --> 00:04:01,562
I understand.

94
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:04,962
If a woman rejects a man,

95
00:04:05,682 --> 00:04:07,402
it means the man
hasn't done well enough.

96
00:04:08,721 --> 00:04:09,601
I'll take your advice.

97
00:04:11,402 --> 00:04:12,881
I'll focus on being the investor.

98
00:04:14,242 --> 00:04:15,041
I believe

99
00:04:15,962 --> 00:04:18,562
the trust and mutual understanding
built in business

100
00:04:19,201 --> 00:04:20,722
will foster more genuine feelings.

101
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:21,802
Alright.

102
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:22,641
Bye then.

103
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:24,201
Yan.

104
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:34,122
Why do you come back alone?

105
00:04:34,722 --> 00:04:35,641
You should've told me,

106
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:37,042
and I would pick you up.

107
00:04:38,521 --> 00:04:39,362
I brought her home.

108
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:44,042
Thank you.

109
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,521
After working hard,

110
00:04:46,682 --> 00:04:48,961
you still help me send my wife home.

111
00:04:49,321 --> 00:04:50,002
It's okay.

112
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:52,881
Ms. Xu has moved out.

113
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:55,722
Now you have to shuttle between places.

114
00:04:56,482 --> 00:04:57,521
She's that kind of person.

115
00:04:58,401 --> 00:04:59,881
Once she makes up her mind,

116
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:02,081
she'll be devoted to it.

117
00:05:03,162 --> 00:05:03,841
It's late now.

118
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:06,401
I won't invite you to my home then.

119
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:06,961
No need.

120
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:09,242
Ms. Xu and I will meet again tomorrow.

121
00:05:09,441 --> 00:05:11,281
You know, collaboration.

122
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,441
We have to meet.

123
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:13,362
I'm leaving.

124
00:05:13,362 --> 00:05:14,362
Looks like rain's coming.

125
00:05:14,521 --> 00:05:14,922
Bye.

126
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:15,641
See you.

127
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:16,682
Let me tell you.

128
00:05:17,722 --> 00:05:20,242
You're already a notorious playboy.

129
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:23,321
Don't try to be a homewrecker now.

130
00:05:26,362 --> 00:05:26,841
Yan.

131
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:56,641
What do you want?

132
00:05:57,401 --> 00:05:58,881
I'm quite happy today.

133
00:05:59,002 --> 00:05:59,922
Does that involve me?

134
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:09,482
I heard you rejected Jiang Liang.

135
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:10,881
You even told him

136
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:12,521
our problem could be resolved.

137
00:06:13,002 --> 00:06:13,922
Of course.

138
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:15,562
With a divorce.

139
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:26,881
Shen Haoming.

140
00:06:29,201 --> 00:06:31,521
Our marriage started without dignity.

141
00:06:32,362 --> 00:06:33,841
Just take what we need.

142
00:06:35,081 --> 00:06:37,441
Now I just want us to part peacefully.

143
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:39,881
Don't worry.

144
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:41,881
I promised your parents

145
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:45,401
to minimize public fallout.

146
00:06:46,081 --> 00:06:47,521
I'll keep my word.

147
00:06:48,881 --> 00:06:49,961
I just want us

148
00:06:50,401 --> 00:06:52,722
to smoothly obtain
the divorce certificate

149
00:06:52,722 --> 00:06:53,841
in our second attempt.

150
00:06:55,242 --> 00:06:56,081
Please cooperate.

151
00:07:05,201 --> 00:07:06,362
Remove your hand.

152
00:07:18,881 --> 00:07:20,162
Stop taking up the elevator.

153
00:07:41,362 --> 00:07:41,961
You're back.

154
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:42,961
You're here.

155
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:45,682
Got off work early
and help you clean up.

156
00:07:46,122 --> 00:07:47,122
I cut some fruits.

157
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:47,841
Have some.

158
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:49,321
Thanks.

159
00:07:51,242 --> 00:07:52,321
I saw from the balcony

160
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:53,802
you returning with Jiang Liang.

161
00:07:54,002 --> 00:07:55,521
You're getting close lately.

162
00:07:56,281 --> 00:07:58,281
Not really, just for work.

163
00:07:59,802 --> 00:08:00,242
So,

164
00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:01,641
you feel nothing about him?

165
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:02,281
Nothing.

166
00:08:22,242 --> 00:08:24,162
What about you and Shen Haoming?

167
00:08:26,602 --> 00:08:27,562
At the resort,

168
00:08:27,562 --> 00:08:28,761
something happened, right?

169
00:08:29,602 --> 00:08:31,281
You're quite nosy.

170
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:35,561
You and Shen Haoming

171
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:37,082
are finalizing the divorce,

172
00:08:37,561 --> 00:08:38,521
but I know

173
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:41,401
you wanted to form a family with him.

174
00:08:42,842 --> 00:08:43,962
You loved him so much,

175
00:08:44,602 --> 00:08:45,921
and now you're parting.

176
00:08:46,082 --> 00:08:47,242
You must be sad.

177
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:49,681
All my focus and energy now

178
00:08:50,122 --> 00:08:51,122
are on work.

179
00:08:51,401 --> 00:08:52,561
No time for others.

180
00:08:53,561 --> 00:08:55,082
It's good to focus on work,

181
00:08:55,482 --> 00:08:56,521
but I believe

182
00:08:56,801 --> 00:08:58,842
even decisive people get confused

183
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:00,801
and don't know what to do sometimes.

184
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:02,842
So I think

185
00:09:03,602 --> 00:09:05,041
you'd better think carefully

186
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,561
and clarify your feelings

187
00:09:06,602 --> 00:09:07,521
before deciding.

188
00:09:07,602 --> 00:09:08,561
Strawberries are good.

189
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:09,082
Try one.

190
00:09:09,242 --> 00:09:10,281
I know they're sweet.

191
00:09:10,761 --> 00:09:11,881
Am I right?

192
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:19,082
You're quite right.

193
00:09:19,362 --> 00:09:20,202
You mentioned

194
00:09:20,202 --> 00:09:21,561
the peach blossom makeup concept.

195
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:22,962
What about the plan?

196
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:24,161
Moreover,

197
00:09:24,561 --> 00:09:25,482
want two assistants,

198
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:26,002
right?

199
00:09:26,242 --> 00:09:27,122
How's that going?

200
00:09:27,322 --> 00:09:28,362
They are indeed sweet.

201
00:09:28,362 --> 00:09:28,842
I'm leaving.

202
00:09:28,842 --> 00:09:29,881
Check the resumes.

203
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:32,401
What about your college exams?

204
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:32,801
Right.

205
00:09:32,921 --> 00:09:34,002
Two subjects, right?

206
00:09:34,482 --> 00:09:35,761

244
00:12:32,761 --> 00:12:33,801
Get out now!

245
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,761
Look at what you have become.

246
00:12:38,281 --> 00:12:39,602
Learn to love yourself

247
00:12:39,602 --> 00:12:40,561
before loving others.

248
00:12:41,881 --> 00:12:43,362
Be an independent woman

and courage to walk away anytime.

253
00:12:50,962 --> 00:12:52,801
Be a relaxed and independent woman.

254
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,161
Live for yourself.

255
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:58,962
If I can't be with Haoming,

256
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:03,921
I'd rather stay single forever.

257
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,401
Stay single forever?

258
00:13:09,281 --> 00:13:10,962
I thought about this before.

259
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:13,122
Let me show you.

260
00:13:15,442 --> 00:13:16,322
When we get old,

261
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,281
we could find a premium nursing home.

262
00:13:21,002 --> 00:13:21,482
And then,

263
00:13:21,561 --> 00:13:24,161
we could take art and music classes.

264
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:25,681
When we get bored,

265
00:13:25,962 --> 00:13:27,401
go sing karaoke, or dance.

266
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:28,202
Interesting?

267
00:13:29,482 --> 00:13:30,442
Here, look.

268
00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:33,521
This one is run by my friend.

269
00:13:33,842 --> 00:13:34,681
Go visit sometime?

270
00:13:42,082 --> 00:13:43,202
Are you insane?

271
00:13:43,842 --> 00:13:45,561
Who would be in a nursing home with you?

272
00:13:48,082 --> 00:13:48,561
Let go!

273
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:49,482
Let go of me!

274
00:14:16,801 --> 00:14:17,521
Thinking?

275
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:19,681
All these years,

276
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,082
you've been chasing Shen Haoming,

277
00:14:22,602 --> 00:14:24,161
yet he married someone else,

278
00:14:24,881 --> 00:14:26,322
didn't even care about you.

279
00:14:28,161 --> 00:14:29,761
If there's a chance to ruin him,

280
00:14:31,242 --> 00:14:32,242
are you interested?

281
00:14:37,161 --> 00:14:39,002
Why suggest that?

282
00:14:47,082 --> 00:14:47,842
Because of you.

283
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:50,161
I don't want

284
00:14:52,202 --> 00:14:54,122
you sinking deeper into darkness.

00:15:08,521 --> 00:15:09,962
Still haven't eaten at this hour?

287
00:15:10,842 --> 00:15:12,122
Mr. Shen is out.

288
00:15:12,242 --> 00:15:14,082
He told me to put this in his office.

289
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:16,242
I'm going.

290
00:15:16,242 --> 00:15:17,041
Want my help?

291
00:15:18,722 --> 00:15:19,442
Well,

292
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:20,602
thanks then.

293
00:15:21,362 --> 00:15:22,202
No need.

294
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:23,041
Go eat now.

(Yan Studio)

298
00:16:00,281 --> 00:16:01,242
As you can see,

299
00:16:01,281 --> 00:16:02,641
our first batch of videos

300
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:04,602
exceeds 10,000 views each.

301
00:16:05,122 --> 00:16:06,281
The top video

302
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:07,681
even surpasses 60,000 clicks.

303
00:16:08,161 --> 00:16:09,881
Therefore, I think we can move on

304
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:11,161
to production phase.

305
00:16:11,602 --> 00:16:12,362
Fantastic!

306
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:14,122
Finally reaching phase two.

307
00:16:15,362 --> 00:16:15,881
Okay.

308
00:16:16,202 --> 00:16:17,962
Today's meeting is

309
00:16:17,962 --> 00:16:19,281
to finalize first collection

310
00:16:19,322 --> 00:16:20,602
and production quantities.

311
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:26,041
I've compiled all sample video metrics

312
00:16:26,041 --> 00:16:27,041
for review.

313
00:16:27,122 --> 00:16:28,881
These five pieces
received the most likes

314
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:30,242
and the highest engagement.

315
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:32,401
And the highest number
of positive reviews.

316
00:16:33,002 --> 00:16:33,641
In my opinion,

317
00:16:33,641 --> 00:16:35,362
sometimes we have to trust the netizens.

318
00:16:35,842 --> 00:16:37,362
Their taste is as good as mine.

319
00:16:37,842 --> 00:16:39,281
I also think they are the best.

320
00:16:40,161 --> 00:16:42,281
Let me share a different perspective.

321
00:16:42,921 --> 00:16:44,842
The biggest highlight
of these five pieces

322
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:46,962
is that they all use brocade fabric.

323
00:16:47,401 --> 00:16:50,002
But this also is
their biggest challenge.

324
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,281
Because this brocade fabric

325
00:16:51,281 --> 00:16:54,161
is handwoven by ethnic minorities.

326
00:16:54,362 --> 00:16:55,761
So, it showcases

327
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:58,082
such intricate craftsmanship
and exquisite texture.

328
00:16:58,921 --> 00:17:02,641
However, their output
is extremely limited.

329
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:04,162
Well,

330
00:17:04,321 --> 00:17:06,041
should we first set up a cooperation

331
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,442
with the producers?

332
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:10,642
But hand-weaving is always

333
00:17:10,682 --> 00:17:12,361
slower compared to machinery.

334
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,922
What if they can't meet our demand?

335
00:17:15,722 --> 00:17:18,081
I've thought about this before.

336
00:17:18,882 --> 00:17:21,402
But we're still in the early phase,

337
00:17:22,202 --> 00:17:24,561
so a small-batch
yet high-quality approach

338
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:25,561
suits us better.

339
00:17:25,841 --> 00:17:26,442
Financially,

340
00:17:26,442 --> 00:17:28,002
it's safer and more secure.

341
00:17:29,202 --> 00:17:30,041
For the first batch,

342
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,536
I want us to focus on

343
00:17:31,696 --> 00:17:32,601
excellence,

344
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:33,361
precision,

345
00:17:33,841 --> 00:17:34,642
and reputation.

346
00:17:35,561 --> 00:17:37,281
As for what Yao mentioned,

347
00:17:38,202 --> 00:17:39,321
we can transform

348
00:17:39,482 --> 00:17:40,962
the challenge of brocade production

349
00:17:41,281 --> 00:17:44,841
into online marketing
advantages and highlights.

350
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:47,002
Many niche designer brands

351
00:17:47,002 --> 00:17:48,321
are now adopting

352
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:49,722
a limited edition

353
00:17:49,722 --> 00:17:50,841
plus pre-sale model.

354
00:17:50,922 --> 00:17:52,281
We can consider this approach too.

355
00:17:53,722 --> 00:17:56,442
For the five styles for the first batch,
100 pieces each.

356
00:17:56,601 --> 00:17:58,081
If we can achieve this,

357
00:17:58,642 --> 00:18:00,081
it could be a success.

358
00:18:04,841 --> 00:18:05,402
Xiaowan,

359
00:18:05,962 --> 00:18:07,482
any ideas for online promotion?

360
00:18:08,202 --> 00:18:10,761
We could organize
reward-based activities

361
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:11,722
to extend the timeline.

362
00:18:11,761 --> 00:18:14,121
This would buy us time for production.

363
00:18:16,242 --> 00:18:18,002
Any other problem to discuss?

364
00:18:19,121 --> 00:18:20,041
Based on Wan's plan,

365
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,922
I'll recruit more influencers

366
00:18:21,962 --> 00:18:23,242
to promote us.

367
00:18:23,521 --> 00:18:25,081
Regarding the fees

368
00:18:25,242 --> 00:18:26,801
for these influencers,

369
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:28,081
could you give me an estimate?

370
00:18:28,242 --> 00:18:28,521
Sure.

371
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:29,361
I'll send it to you.

372
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:30,002
Good.

373
00:18:32,722 --> 00:18:34,841
I can reach out to bloggers,

374
00:18:34,841 --> 00:18:36,121
offer them free makeup services,

375
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:37,962
and let them wear our outfits in posts.

376
00:18:37,962 --> 00:18:39,162
That should help, right?

377
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:47,202
Why did you ask to meet?

378
00:18:47,722 --> 00:18:48,962
Can't I just want to see you?

379
00:18:49,202 --> 00:18:50,561
Join me for afternoon tea?

380
00:18:51,002 --> 00:18:51,922
Sure.

381
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:54,801
How have you been?

382
00:18:55,442 --> 00:18:56,642
Haven't seen you in days.

383
00:18:57,162 --> 00:18:58,442
Focus on work

384
00:18:58,442 --> 00:19:00,442
or on someone?

385
00:19:03,882 --> 00:19:05,841
No one understands me like you do.

386
00:19:06,321 --> 00:19:07,402
Same old me.

387
00:19:08,321 --> 00:19:11,242
I can't stand seeing
female friends suffering,

388
00:19:11,242 --> 00:19:12,561
so I have to help them.

389
00:19:12,761 --> 00:19:13,682
What can I do?

390
00:19:14,402 --> 00:19:17,521
There are too many female friends
you want to help.

391
00:19:18,281 --> 00:19:19,482
Which one this time?

392
00:19:21,482 --> 00:19:21,962
Xu Yan.

393
00:19:24,722 --> 00:19:25,601
Xu Yan?

394
00:19:29,642 --> 00:19:30,801
Are you out of your mind?

395
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,962
Xu Yan is Shen Haoming's wife.

396
00:19:34,361 --> 00:19:35,521
We're in the negotiation.

397
00:19:37,002 --> 00:19:38,002
So what?

398
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:39,521
I'm her investor.

399
00:19:39,962 --> 00:19:40,561
Besides,

400
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:41,482
heard the rumors?

401
00:19:41,482 --> 00:19:42,521
They're getting divorced.

402
00:19:42,601 --> 00:19:43,801
I don't care about rumors.

403
00:19:44,442 --> 00:19:46,442
But I don't want you to help her.

404
00:19:56,242 --> 00:19:56,962
Haochen.

405
00:19:58,321 --> 00:19:59,402
What is it, Coach Lu?

406
00:19:59,682 --> 00:20:00,722
I want to recommend you

407
00:20:00,761 --> 00:20:02,922
for this year's
Junior Equestrian Championship.

408
00:20:03,521 --> 00:20:04,121
However,

409
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:05,841
we need to consult
your family's opinions.

410
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,281
Have your family come over

411
00:20:08,162 --> 00:20:10,682
to discuss your training schedule
for the second half.

412
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:13,361
Just call my sister-in-law.

413
00:20:13,442 --> 00:20:14,922
She handles all my affairs.

414
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:15,682
Alright.

415
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:16,841
I'll contact her.

416
00:20:21,482 --> 00:20:22,002
Haoming.

417
00:20:22,202 --> 00:20:23,041
Come here.

418
00:20:23,081 --> 00:20:24,761
I've got amazing news!

419
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,642
If you want to join the championship,

420
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:29,361
the technical difficulty and
training intensity will both increase.

421
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,922
Haochen is very interested himself.

422
00:20:31,162 --> 00:20:33,321
I wonder what you two think.

423
00:20:36,521 --> 00:20:37,922
Haochen has trained for four years.

424
00:20:38,601 --> 00:20:39,841
If he's interested,

425
00:20:40,081 --> 00:20:41,321
I'll definitely support him.

426
00:20:45,801 --> 00:20:47,202
Honey, what do you think?

427
00:20:54,801 --> 00:20:55,482
Coach Lu,

428
00:20:56,402 --> 00:20:57,761
Haochen's records show

429
00:20:57,761 --> 00:20:59,521
he's completed
over 350 training sessions.

430
00:21:02,281 --> 00:21:03,722
If he wants to participate,

431
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:04,962
we'll definitely support him.

432
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,841
But I have one question.

433
00:21:08,242 --> 00:21:09,561
He's nearly 160 cm tall.

434
00:21:10,482 --> 00:21:12,242
His current horse might be too small.

435
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:14,002
If it's too small,

436
00:21:14,162 --> 00:21:15,801
jumping obstacles could be dangerous.

437
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:18,722
Yes.

438
00:21:18,882 --> 00:21:19,682
For the competition,

439
00:21:19,682 --> 00:21:21,801
we'll adjust equipment to his height.

440
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:23,242
Glad to hear that.

441
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:23,642
Okay.

442
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:26,482
I'll start working on the registration.

443
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:27,882
Thank you.

444
00:21:28,682 --> 00:21:29,242
- Thanks.
- Not at all.

445
00:21:29,242 --> 00:21:29,801
Thank you.

446
00:21:36,242 --> 00:21:37,081
Call me anytime.

447
00:21:37,242 --> 00:21:37,761
I'm leaving.

448
00:21:39,121 --> 00:21:40,002
Wait!

449
00:21:42,682 --> 00:21:43,361
Well,

450
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,922
the fresh juices here are tasty.

451
00:21:45,922 --> 00:21:46,841
Want to try some?

452
00:21:48,402 --> 00:21:48,801
Sure!

453
00:21:48,801 --> 00:21:49,801
I'll go get you some.

454
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:51,002
Wait for me!

455
00:21:59,561 --> 00:22:00,922
The juice here is pretty good.

456
00:22:03,442 --> 00:22:04,162
I know.

457
00:22:19,722 --> 00:22:20,561
Sit down and wait?

458
00:22:30,361 --> 00:22:32,162
Please tell Haochen

459
00:22:32,841 --> 00:22:34,002
I need to leave now.

460
00:22:34,801 --> 00:22:36,561
I left a meeting halfway to come here.

461
00:22:37,682 --> 00:22:38,081
Okay.

462
00:22:38,761 --> 00:22:39,361
Thanks.

463
00:22:56,601 --> 00:22:57,202
Where's she?

464
00:22:57,841 --> 00:22:59,002
She had work to attend to

465
00:22:59,801 --> 00:23:00,281
and left.

466
00:23:00,682 --> 00:23:02,482
Why are you still sitting here?

467
00:23:03,242 --> 00:23:04,041
Oh my!

468
00:23:06,162 --> 00:23:08,202
You're driving me crazy!

469
00:23:08,442 --> 00:23:10,281
Even I know

470
00:23:10,361 --> 00:23:11,722
you should fix your mistakes.

471
00:23:11,962 --> 00:23:13,841
You made her mad,

472
00:23:13,922 --> 00:23:15,002
and now she's ignoring you.

473
00:23:15,002 --> 00:23:16,402
You need to do something!

474
00:23:19,642 --> 00:23:21,081
Yan has been sincere

475
00:23:21,722 --> 00:23:23,041
to Haochen.

476
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:25,281
After all,

477
00:23:25,962 --> 00:23:27,361
it's all for you.

478
00:23:28,601 --> 00:23:30,081
Otherwise, to her,

479
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:32,281
Haochen is just some random child.

480
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:37,121
She's always adored Haochen.

481
00:23:37,922 --> 00:23:38,922
Why involves me?

482
00:23:39,361 --> 00:23:40,482
Of course, it involves you.

483
00:23:40,761 --> 00:23:42,002
"Love me, love my dog."

484
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:44,561
She loves you,

485
00:23:45,002 --> 00:23:47,121
so she values our family.

486
00:23:48,202 --> 00:23:49,642
After you two married,

487
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:51,081
she's treated me,

488
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:52,321
your father,

489
00:23:52,402 --> 00:23:53,121
and Haochen

490
00:23:53,402 --> 00:23:54,642
with sincerity.

491
00:23:55,081 --> 00:23:57,601
Her care has always been tangible.

492
00:23:58,281 --> 00:23:59,841
And I truly felt it.

493
00:24:02,761 --> 00:24:05,321
After decades in business,

494
00:24:06,121 --> 00:24:08,601
I've encountered all types of people.

495
00:24:09,962 --> 00:24:11,442
But when Yan looks at you,

496
00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:15,321
I can tell how deeply she loves you.

497
00:24:18,442 --> 00:24:19,801
Actually,

498
00:24:19,962 --> 00:24:21,402
it's part of my fault that you two

499
00:24:22,041 --> 00:24:23,442
are getting divorce now.

500
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:26,922
From the start,

501
00:24:27,202 --> 00:24:29,521
I wanted you to marry someone matched

502
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,601
so I was harsh to Yan,

503
00:24:33,402 --> 00:24:34,642
and tried every mean

504
00:24:34,761 --> 00:24:35,801
to drive her away.

505
00:24:37,321 --> 00:24:39,002
I deeply regret that now.

506
00:24:41,002 --> 00:24:42,801
Had I not done those,

507
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:45,642
she wouldn't have lied
about her family backgrounds

508
00:24:46,482 --> 00:24:48,242
to prove herself.

509
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:52,722
I've no right

510
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:54,361
to blame her for deceiving me.

511
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,081
From the beginning,

512
00:24:58,162 --> 00:24:59,041
I'd already decided

513
00:24:59,882 --> 00:25:01,801
to hide Haochen's background.

514
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:07,041
Now that you've talked things through,

515
00:25:07,482 --> 00:25:09,922
I think you may get back together.

516
00:25:12,202 --> 00:25:12,801
Haoming.

517
00:25:14,321 --> 00:25:15,242
I truly cherish Yan

518
00:25:15,242 --> 00:25:16,242
as my daughter-in-law.

519
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:21,482
She reminds me of my younger self.

520
00:25:22,882 --> 00:25:23,882
Driven,

521
00:25:24,561 --> 00:25:26,121
hardworking,

522
00:25:27,162 --> 00:25:28,321
able to handle both society

523
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:30,081
and hard labor.

524
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:33,041
When she did supermarket live streams,

525
00:25:33,841 --> 00:25:34,761
she swallowed her pride

526
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:36,002
and standing on her own.

527
00:25:36,761 --> 00:25:38,321
She made no excuses

528
00:25:38,321 --> 00:25:39,882
for her mistakes,

529
00:25:40,601 --> 00:25:42,041
but fight for what she wanted

530
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:44,162
through sheer determination.

531
00:25:45,922 --> 00:25:47,242
That's when I knew

532
00:25:48,002 --> 00:25:50,561
she was meant to be
the hostess of Shen Family.

533
00:25:51,321 --> 00:25:52,121
Just like you,

534
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,761
she's a pillar of our family.

535
00:25:57,482 --> 00:25:58,321
Promise me.

536
00:25:59,081 --> 00:26:00,642
No matter what it takes,

537
00:26:01,482 --> 00:26:03,081
bring Yan back.

538
00:26:05,081 --> 00:26:06,242
When I married her,

539
00:26:07,761 --> 00:26:09,361
I vowed to never let go.

540
00:26:12,722 --> 00:26:13,561
You can do this.

541
00:26:30,402 --> 00:26:30,801
Come on.

542
00:26:30,801 --> 00:26:31,561
Good job.

543
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:32,922
That's it for today.

544
00:26:35,281 --> 00:26:35,801
Lin.

545
00:26:35,922 --> 00:26:37,041
I'll book you again.

546
00:26:37,402 --> 00:26:37,922
Thank you.

547
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:39,801
See you Friday.

548
00:26:39,841 --> 00:26:40,121
Got it.

549
00:26:40,321 --> 00:26:40,841
Bye.

550
00:26:41,402 --> 00:26:41,922
Take care.

551
00:26:47,922 --> 00:26:48,442
Zheng!

552
00:26:49,121 --> 00:26:50,121
Are you okay?

553
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:51,120
Twisted my ankle.

554
00:26:51,321 --> 00:26:52,162
Can you move?

555
00:26:52,442 --> 00:26:52,922
It hurts.

556
00:26:53,121 --> 00:26:53,761
I can't move.

557
00:26:55,002 --> 00:26:56,002
Let's go to the hospital.

558
00:26:56,561 --> 00:26:57,281
Don't delay.

559
00:26:57,601 --> 00:26:58,041
Let's go.

560
00:26:58,041 --> 00:26:58,601
Come on.

561
00:26:58,882 --> 00:26:59,482
Hello, sir.

562
00:27:02,722 --> 00:27:04,801
The doctor let him stay
a few days for observation.

563
00:27:11,601 --> 00:27:12,162
Bye.

564
00:27:27,002 --> 00:27:27,761
Scumbag!

565
00:27:28,482 --> 00:27:30,402
I knew you weren't sincere with Lin.

566
00:27:32,002 --> 00:27:32,601
Lin.

567
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:34,642
Come to the hospital cafeteria now.

568
00:27:34,882 --> 00:27:36,281
See what Yu Yiming's been doing

569
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:37,242
(Jingzhou Yuekang Hospital, Outpatient)
behind your back.

570
00:27:45,642 --> 00:27:46,722
Outrageous.

571
00:27:47,121 --> 00:27:48,442
Just now she held his hand.

572
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:50,521
Now he's patting her shoulder.

573
00:27:50,922 --> 00:27:51,882
They've been together

574
00:27:51,882 --> 00:27:52,962
for 26 minutes.

575
00:27:53,202 --> 00:27:54,121
In front of me,

576
00:27:54,121 --> 00:27:55,682
he keeps declaring his love for you.

577
00:27:56,002 --> 00:27:56,962
Look what he's doing!

578
00:27:57,402 --> 00:27:59,162
Touchy-feely in public.

579
00:27:59,162 --> 00:28:00,081
No sense of propriety.

580
00:28:00,962 --> 00:28:02,962
He's practically a male coquette!

581
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:04,242
Shut up!

582
00:28:05,121 --> 00:28:06,162
Stop rambling.

583
00:28:07,841 --> 00:28:09,202
Move away.

584
00:28:12,202 --> 00:28:12,761
Lin.

585
00:28:13,202 --> 00:28:13,722
Lin.

586
00:28:14,882 --> 00:28:15,521
Scumbag!

587
00:28:15,601 --> 00:28:16,361
Senior.

588
00:28:18,882 --> 00:28:20,848
This is my first patient

589
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,761
who died since I became a resident.

590
00:28:32,242 --> 00:28:32,922
Wenjin.

591
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:36,642
I've been through these too.

592
00:28:39,081 --> 00:28:40,642
There are patients we want to save

593
00:28:41,962 --> 00:28:42,761
but can't.

594
00:28:43,242 --> 00:28:45,761
When we face their grieving family,
we don't know what to say.

595
00:28:46,761 --> 00:28:47,882
I know

596
00:28:49,002 --> 00:28:50,242
how hard it is

597
00:28:52,121 --> 00:28:53,482
for you.

598
00:28:54,601 --> 00:28:55,761
But as doctors,

599
00:28:56,081 --> 00:28:58,242
we must face this and overcome it.

600
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:03,202
There are other patients waiting for us.

601
00:29:03,561 --> 00:29:04,041
Lin.

602
00:29:05,521 --> 00:29:06,081
Lin.

603
00:29:08,002 --> 00:29:08,521
Lin!

604
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:11,601
Please listen to me.

605
00:29:11,962 --> 00:29:12,402
Go ahead.

606
00:29:13,561 --> 00:29:15,121
I know you're hurting.

607
00:29:16,442 --> 00:29:19,761
But you must see his true nature.

608
00:29:21,121 --> 00:29:23,002
Yu Yiming's conditions are good.

609
00:29:24,242 --> 00:29:24,801
I admit that.

610
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:28,482
But people living in big cities

611
00:29:28,682 --> 00:29:30,321
think realistically.

612
00:29:31,281 --> 00:29:32,601
Your social status, background,

613
00:29:32,601 --> 00:29:33,321
education, and job

614
00:29:33,321 --> 00:29:34,521
are worlds apart from his.

615
00:29:34,722 --> 00:29:36,402
Do you really think he doesn't care?

616
00:29:39,162 --> 00:29:39,482
Lin Tao.

617
00:29:39,482 --> 00:29:40,841
I don't care what you saw.

618
00:29:40,962 --> 00:29:41,841
I just believe

619
00:29:41,841 --> 00:29:43,761
that Yu Yiming is not that kind of man.

620
00:29:44,442 --> 00:29:45,002
Well, Lin.

621
00:29:45,002 --> 00:29:46,761
Why don't you believe me?

622
00:29:46,761 --> 00:29:48,121
I'm the one who truly...

623
00:29:53,722 --> 00:29:54,962
Where's that bruise from?

624
00:29:55,442 --> 00:29:56,521
You fought?

625
00:29:56,922 --> 00:29:57,521
Well...

626
00:29:58,402 --> 00:30:00,080
I'm now a sparring partner
at an MMA gym.

627
00:30:01,761 --> 00:30:02,482
Why?

628
00:30:03,202 --> 00:30:03,962
To take punches.

629
00:30:04,642 --> 00:30:05,801
You like hitting people.

630
00:30:06,002 --> 00:30:06,841
No problem.

631
00:30:07,202 --> 00:30:08,482
If hitting me makes you happy,

632
00:30:08,922 --> 00:30:09,962
just do it.

633
00:30:10,162 --> 00:30:10,682
Lin.

634
00:30:11,081 --> 00:30:13,442
I'm ready to be
your punching bag for life.

635
00:30:19,561 --> 00:30:20,202
Lin Tao.

636
00:30:21,081 --> 00:30:22,202
The matter between us

637
00:30:22,761 --> 00:30:24,041
has dragged on long enough.

638
00:30:27,162 --> 00:30:29,081
Can we calmly

639
00:30:29,081 --> 00:30:30,321
talk it through today?

640
00:30:32,242 --> 00:30:32,801
Okay.

641
00:30:36,121 --> 00:30:36,682
I know

642
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:39,242
you gave a lot

643
00:30:40,002 --> 00:30:41,041
to this relationship.

644
00:30:42,002 --> 00:30:43,722
But we've both realized we're not right

645
00:30:43,722 --> 00:30:44,882
for each other.

646
00:30:45,402 --> 00:30:47,041
Breaking up is the best choice.

647
00:30:49,121 --> 00:30:50,962
We're never getting back together.

648
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:54,442
So,

649
00:30:55,402 --> 00:30:56,722
I hope you can let go.

650
00:30:58,442 --> 00:30:59,801
Don't you want me to be happy?

651
00:31:01,682 --> 00:31:03,722
I am now.

652
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:05,601
Look,

653
00:31:05,601 --> 00:31:06,521
I've got my sister

654
00:31:06,922 --> 00:31:09,041
and my startup team by my side.

655
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:11,642
My life is full and busy.

656
00:31:14,121 --> 00:31:15,041
I also hope

657
00:31:16,642 --> 00:31:18,402
that you get back

658
00:31:18,601 --> 00:31:19,922
on your own path.

659
00:31:20,761 --> 00:31:21,321
Lin Tao.

660
00:31:23,361 --> 00:31:24,482
I wish you well too.

661
00:31:30,162 --> 00:31:30,642
I'll leave.

662
00:31:42,202 --> 00:31:42,922
Lin.

663
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,552
Take good care of yourself.

664
00:31:48,962 --> 00:31:49,922
How's Xu Yan's company

665
00:31:49,922 --> 00:31:51,041
doing lately?

666
00:31:51,402 --> 00:31:53,561
They're doing great.

667
00:31:53,962 --> 00:31:55,521
Their newly released short videos

668
00:31:55,601 --> 00:31:56,841
get over 10,000 likes,

669
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:00,281
all with much better quality.

670
00:32:01,682 --> 00:32:02,521
Currently,

671
00:32:02,682 --> 00:32:03,761
this market is competitive.

672
00:32:04,002 --> 00:32:05,521
With numerous production stages,

673
00:32:06,002 --> 00:32:07,722
achieving such results this fast

674
00:32:08,002 --> 00:32:08,841
is truly remarkable.

675
00:32:10,722 --> 00:32:13,482
No wonder Jiang Liang
has been showing off.

676
00:32:14,281 --> 00:32:15,841
Actually, I think

677
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:17,922
Yan works hard

678
00:32:18,442 --> 00:32:19,482
just to prove her worth

679
00:32:19,482 --> 00:32:20,561
and strength to you.

680
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:22,002
These days

681
00:32:22,281 --> 00:32:25,002
people want equal and balanced love.

682
00:32:25,321 --> 00:32:26,841
She's an independent woman.

683
00:32:27,682 --> 00:32:29,002
Surely she wants to succeed first

684
00:32:29,002 --> 00:32:29,801
before returning.

685
00:32:31,722 --> 00:32:32,682
Really?

686
00:32:32,922 --> 00:32:33,482
Absolutely.

687
00:32:33,808 --> 00:32:34,642
Think about it.

688
00:32:34,962 --> 00:32:37,801
If she really wanted to cut ties,

689
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:40,041
why would she agree to the resort trip?

690
00:32:40,442 --> 00:32:41,841
Why would she help you

691
00:32:42,202 --> 00:32:43,482
win over Mr. Baraikin?

692
00:32:46,642 --> 00:32:47,242
Three days.

693
00:32:47,521 --> 00:32:48,521
You have to be together

694
00:32:48,521 --> 00:32:50,002
all the time,

695
00:32:50,482 --> 00:32:51,722
pretending to be close,

696
00:32:52,521 --> 00:32:53,882
even sharing a room.

697
00:32:55,801 --> 00:32:56,642
Let me tell you.

698
00:32:57,402 --> 00:32:59,801
If a woman truly hates a man,

699
00:33:00,081 --> 00:33:01,761
she wouldn't spend
even a second with him.

700
00:33:03,882 --> 00:33:04,882
Remember

701
00:33:05,242 --> 00:33:08,281
the romantic room at Yanbo Resort?

702
00:33:08,722 --> 00:33:09,882
That passionate setup.

703
00:33:11,002 --> 00:33:12,321
Yan didn't object at all, right?

704
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:18,321
You did a good job.

705
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:21,722
If she truly had no feelings left,
why would she do that?

706
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:24,482
But she keeps wanting a divorce.

707
00:33:25,162 --> 00:33:26,521
That's just anger talking.

708
00:33:28,321 --> 00:33:30,202
My girlfriend used to threaten breakup

709
00:33:30,521 --> 00:33:31,402
when got mad.

710
00:33:31,682 --> 00:33:32,242
Really.

711
00:33:34,962 --> 00:33:37,162
How did you become such a smooth talker?

712
00:33:37,962 --> 00:33:38,482
Sit down.

713
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:41,162
Keep going.

714
00:33:44,402 --> 00:33:45,561
Now,

715
00:33:45,841 --> 00:33:47,682
to win her back

716
00:33:47,722 --> 00:33:48,801
by direct communication

717
00:33:49,281 --> 00:33:50,361
is hard.

718
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:53,081
But there's a method that always works.

719
00:33:53,162 --> 00:33:53,922
What is it?

720
00:33:54,722 --> 00:33:55,601
Indirect strategy.

721
00:33:56,402 --> 00:33:57,841
Go find her friends.

722
00:33:57,962 --> 00:33:58,801
That would help.

723
00:33:58,922 --> 00:33:59,402
No use.

724
00:33:59,761 --> 00:34:01,482
I tried Qiao Lin, but she refused.

725
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:03,361
What about male friends?

726
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:04,922
At such times,

727
00:34:05,081 --> 00:34:06,482
men often understand each other.

728
00:34:08,561 --> 00:34:10,442
Male friends?

729
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:14,882
She does have one.

730
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:42,704
Coming!

731
00:34:44,592 --> 00:34:45,872
Qiao Lin. Perfect timing.

732
00:34:45,872 --> 00:34:47,792
I'm making breakfast
and want to bring you some.

733
00:34:47,792 --> 00:34:48,521
Take any seat.

734
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:55,762
- I'll get you some fruit.
- Wait.

735
00:34:56,362 --> 00:34:57,641
I have something to say.

736
00:34:58,842 --> 00:34:59,561
Go ahead.

737
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:01,521
Sit down.

738
00:35:08,561 --> 00:35:09,201
Yu Yiming.

739
00:35:13,161 --> 00:35:13,882
I like you.

740
00:35:17,002 --> 00:35:18,442
- Qiao Lin, actually...
- Let me finish.

741
00:35:18,561 --> 00:35:19,161
Okay.

742
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:27,601
Yes, I always do what I want,

743
00:35:28,161 --> 00:35:29,962
but I'm not that naive.

744
00:35:32,121 --> 00:35:33,282
I'm very aware

745
00:35:33,442 --> 00:35:35,521
of the real differences between us.

746
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:38,201
Those can't be ignored.

747
00:35:42,402 --> 00:35:43,842
I know there are

748
00:35:44,282 --> 00:35:45,681
many outstanding people around you.

749
00:35:45,962 --> 00:35:47,802
Like that female doctor

750
00:35:47,802 --> 00:35:49,081
I saw in the cafeteria.

751
00:35:49,762 --> 00:35:51,081
Realistically,

752
00:35:51,201 --> 00:35:52,681
they're more successful,

753
00:35:52,721 --> 00:35:55,362
and also better matches for you.

754
00:35:55,482 --> 00:35:57,362
You share the same profession

755
00:35:58,161 --> 00:35:59,521
so you'd have more topics

756
00:35:59,601 --> 00:36:00,561
and pursuits in common.

757
00:36:01,081 --> 00:36:01,442
However,

758
00:36:02,762 --> 00:36:05,121
I don't think this means

759
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,322
I'm unworthy of liking you.

760
00:36:10,482 --> 00:36:12,041
I believe

761
00:36:12,521 --> 00:36:13,962
you have the right to choose.

762
00:36:15,002 --> 00:36:15,612
So...

763
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,362
If you think

764
00:36:18,362 --> 00:36:20,282
she is more suitable,

765
00:36:22,802 --> 00:36:25,241
I won't force it.

766
00:36:32,842 --> 00:36:33,482
Qiao Lin.

767
00:36:37,121 --> 00:36:38,201
What's with you today?

768
00:36:39,561 --> 00:36:40,762
Did something happen to you?

769
00:36:44,721 --> 00:36:45,882
Yesterday,

770
00:36:45,882 --> 00:36:47,041
at the hospital cafeteria,

771
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:48,521
I saw you with Dr. Xu.

772
00:36:49,402 --> 00:36:50,402
She looked distressed

773
00:36:50,681 --> 00:36:52,121
and you tried to comfort her.

774
00:36:52,201 --> 00:36:53,362
She seemed to need you.

775
00:36:56,282 --> 00:36:57,721
I-I don't know what to say.

776
00:36:59,442 --> 00:37:00,208
Didn't sleep well?

777
00:37:04,161 --> 00:37:05,442
Yesterday,

778
00:37:06,081 --> 00:37:06,922
it was her first time

779
00:37:07,002 --> 00:37:08,241
losing a patient.

780
00:37:08,362 --> 00:37:09,521
So I consoled her.

781
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:10,922
But rest assured.

782
00:37:11,241 --> 00:37:13,121
There's nothing beyond colleagues.

783
00:37:13,561 --> 00:37:14,041
Really.

784
00:37:16,762 --> 00:37:17,802
I trust you.

785
00:37:18,962 --> 00:37:20,282
Also, I trust your character.

786
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:23,482
But the reality between us

787
00:37:24,282 --> 00:37:25,521
still exist.

788
00:37:26,882 --> 00:37:27,962
I don't know

789
00:37:27,962 --> 00:37:30,081
if it will create obstacles

790
00:37:30,201 --> 00:37:31,241
for us.

791
00:37:32,402 --> 00:37:33,161
So...

792
00:37:34,482 --> 00:37:37,721
Maybe we should

793
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:39,362
take a week apart

794
00:37:39,442 --> 00:37:40,521
to think it over.

795
00:37:42,402 --> 00:37:43,482
No, Qiao Lin. I don't...

796
00:37:45,521 --> 00:37:46,362
This week,

797
00:37:47,081 --> 00:37:48,002
don't contact me.

798
00:37:55,842 --> 00:37:56,362
Okay.

799
00:37:58,482 --> 00:37:59,762
Once I confirm it,

800
00:37:59,762 --> 00:38:00,681
I'll message you.

801
00:38:06,922 --> 00:38:07,402
Alright.

802
00:38:09,842 --> 00:38:10,482
How's it going?

803
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:12,322
I've secured cooperation

804
00:38:12,322 --> 00:38:14,842
with three weaving villages
for brocade production.

805
00:38:15,442 --> 00:38:17,282
They'll supply us long-term.

806
00:38:18,442 --> 00:38:19,362
That's good.

807
00:38:19,721 --> 00:38:20,882
Now we can send orders

808
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:21,762
to the factory.

809
00:38:21,962 --> 00:38:22,601
I'll follow up.

810
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:23,241
Wait a second.

811
00:38:24,442 --> 00:38:25,002
Sit down.

812
00:38:28,962 --> 00:38:30,681
Did something happen?

813
00:38:31,241 --> 00:38:31,962
Look at you.

814
00:38:39,802 --> 00:38:41,282
There are only two people

815
00:38:41,322 --> 00:38:42,442
that can make you

816
00:38:42,601 --> 00:38:44,041
be this shaken.

817
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:46,402
One is Lin Tao,

818
00:38:47,762 --> 00:38:49,002
the other is Yu Yiming.

819
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:49,721
Which one?

820
00:38:50,282 --> 00:38:51,721
Yu Yiming, of course.

821
00:38:54,962 --> 00:38:57,081
Young love during school days
was so simple.

822
00:38:57,721 --> 00:38:59,962
No need to think about
the future or the outcomes,

823
00:39:00,002 --> 00:39:01,561
just loved.

824
00:39:02,521 --> 00:39:03,561
But now,

825
00:39:03,762 --> 00:39:05,442
the more I want to be with someone,

826
00:39:06,121 --> 00:39:08,721
the more I can't help
thinking about reality.

827
00:39:13,121 --> 00:39:14,322
That means you've grown up.

828
00:39:15,842 --> 00:39:17,161
You used to be so carefree.

829
00:39:17,681 --> 00:39:19,376
How could you ever
ponder over such things?

830
00:39:19,641 --> 00:39:21,241
When I was young,

831
00:39:21,802 --> 00:39:23,561
I thought love was all sweet.

832
00:39:24,081 --> 00:39:25,521
But now I understand

833
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:27,882
there isn't just sweetness,

834
00:39:27,882 --> 00:39:29,161
but bitterness,

835
00:39:29,521 --> 00:39:30,442
insecurity,

836
00:39:30,762 --> 00:39:31,402
pride,

837
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:32,282
and pain.

838
00:39:32,842 --> 00:39:37,201
All kinds of contradictions intertwined.

839
00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:39,882
But I just can't let go.

840
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,241
I understand how you feel right now.

841
00:39:58,081 --> 00:39:59,561
But this is what love is.

842
00:40:02,842 --> 00:40:05,081
Everything you just said

843
00:40:05,721 --> 00:40:07,521
is part of love.

844
00:40:09,442 --> 00:40:10,561
Don't run from it.

845
00:40:10,922 --> 00:40:12,041
You can't run anyway.

846
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:15,802
So you could try to accept it,

847
00:40:16,442 --> 00:40:17,161
understand it,

848
00:40:17,922 --> 00:40:18,762
and feel it.

849
00:40:19,561 --> 00:40:21,482
Maybe in that process,

850
00:40:22,121 --> 00:40:23,681
you'll find the answers you seek.

851
00:40:24,962 --> 00:40:26,802
No need to drain yourself like this.

852
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:29,241
That's true.

853
00:40:33,081 --> 00:40:33,922
I'll think about it.

854
00:40:34,121 --> 00:40:34,681
I'm leaving.

855
00:40:37,282 --> 00:40:37,842
Wait.

856
00:40:38,641 --> 00:40:39,601
Well...

857
00:40:40,081 --> 00:40:42,121
Don't forget the makeup class.

858
00:40:44,681 --> 00:40:45,201
Okay.

859
00:40:45,362 --> 00:40:45,882
Bye.

860
00:40:47,002 --> 00:40:47,842
Goodbye.

861
00:40:57,498 --> 00:41:01,360
(Yan Studio)

862
00:41:05,601 --> 00:41:06,282
Yu Yiming.

863
00:41:10,681 --> 00:41:11,760
You're here for my sister?

864
00:41:13,482 --> 00:41:13,962
Yes.

865
00:41:15,561 --> 00:41:16,561
Your coworkers said

866
00:41:16,802 --> 00:41:17,721
she isn't here.

867
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:19,681
So I'm waiting here.

868
00:41:23,002 --> 00:41:24,362
Does she not want to see me?

869
00:41:26,362 --> 00:41:27,601
She really isn't here.

870
00:41:28,161 --> 00:41:30,442
This morning she had makeup class,

871
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:32,362
this afternoon a beauty launch event.

872
00:41:32,802 --> 00:41:34,802
She's looking for the newest products

873
00:41:34,962 --> 00:41:36,521
and preparing for the entrance exams.

874
00:41:37,201 --> 00:41:38,041
She's busy.

875
00:41:38,322 --> 00:41:39,201
Even I barely see her.

876
00:41:39,762 --> 00:41:41,482
Don't overthink it.
She really isn't here.

877
00:41:43,721 --> 00:41:44,442
Got it.

878
00:41:45,322 --> 00:41:46,641
Qiao Lin has told me

879
00:41:46,641 --> 00:41:47,762
about you two.

880
00:41:49,121 --> 00:41:50,521
I think she's right.

881
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:53,041
If you ignore

882
00:41:53,241 --> 00:41:55,041
these differences now,

883
00:41:55,442 --> 00:41:57,041
bigger issues might arise later.

884
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:59,402
So you both should calm down

885
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:00,601
and think carefully

886
00:42:00,962 --> 00:42:02,641
whether you can accept it.

887
00:42:04,681 --> 00:42:05,521
She's more rational

888
00:42:05,962 --> 00:42:07,081
than before.

889
00:42:07,802 --> 00:42:09,296
That means you're important to her.

890
00:42:09,922 --> 00:42:11,081
Do you get me?

891
00:42:13,081 --> 00:42:13,882
Okay, I understand.

892
00:42:15,882 --> 00:42:16,802
I'll wait patiently.

893
00:42:18,482 --> 00:42:19,521
These flowers...

894
00:42:19,641 --> 00:42:20,521
I'll give them to her.

895
00:42:21,721 --> 00:42:22,322
Thank you.

896
00:42:23,322 --> 00:42:23,922
I'm leaving.

897
00:42:25,322 --> 00:42:25,922
Take care.

898
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:41,002
Hello?

899
00:42:42,922 --> 00:42:43,762
I'm Shen Haoming.

900
00:42:45,002 --> 00:42:45,922
Shen Haoming?

901
00:42:58,721 --> 00:42:59,521
What's up?

902
00:43:01,402 --> 00:43:01,922
Have a seat.

903
00:43:11,601 --> 00:43:12,161
Thank you.

904
00:43:13,922 --> 00:43:15,282
You like Xu Yan, don't you?

905
00:43:18,282 --> 00:43:19,482
Don't get me wrong.

906
00:43:20,041 --> 00:43:20,641
Yes.

907
00:43:21,882 --> 00:43:23,282
I had feelings for her,

908
00:43:24,402 --> 00:43:25,882
but that was many years ago.

909
00:43:26,442 --> 00:43:27,802
I admit when I saw her again,

910
00:43:28,402 --> 00:43:29,362
I still had a soft spot.

911
00:43:30,601 --> 00:43:32,041
But I know that's not love.

912
00:43:33,561 --> 00:43:35,241
Besides, I'm now with Qiao Lin.

913
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:41,402
I know you're not involved with her.

914
00:43:42,322 --> 00:43:43,402
I asked you here today

915
00:43:44,362 --> 00:43:45,482
to request your help.

916
00:43:46,322 --> 00:43:47,201
How can I help?

917
00:43:47,762 --> 00:43:49,442
You've known her since childhood.

918
00:43:50,201 --> 00:43:51,721
You must understand her well, right?

919
00:43:53,201 --> 00:43:54,962
I hope you can help me win her back.

920
00:43:57,521 --> 00:43:58,521
You're mistaken.

921
00:43:59,002 --> 00:44:01,081
Qiao Lin and I have problems too.

922
00:44:02,922 --> 00:44:04,081
I don't know how to help you.

923
00:44:04,802 --> 00:44:06,041
Where are things now?

924
00:44:06,521 --> 00:44:07,632
Breakup cooling-off period.

925
00:44:10,282 --> 00:44:10,802
And you?

926
00:44:11,402 --> 00:44:12,560
Divorce cooling-off period.

927
00:44:12,721 --> 00:44:13,402
Let me toast you.

928
00:44:17,201 --> 00:44:18,362
So you're saying

929
00:44:19,561 --> 00:44:23,641
you used to think you didn't love her,
but now you've fallen for her again?

930
00:44:24,282 --> 00:44:24,962
No.

931
00:44:25,081 --> 00:44:26,762
After we broke up...

932
00:44:27,641 --> 00:44:28,802
It's not "fallen again".

933
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:31,482
I've always loved her.

934
00:44:38,002 --> 00:44:40,282
But I've never felt this lost before.

935
00:44:40,962 --> 00:44:42,721
I don't know what to do

936
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,282
to get her back.

937
00:44:44,842 --> 00:44:46,041
I only know one thing.

938
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:48,081
I won't let her go.

939
00:44:48,362 --> 00:44:49,442
Let me tell you.

940
00:44:51,402 --> 00:44:52,362
I hadn't seen Xu Yan

941
00:44:52,402 --> 00:44:53,641
since high school graduation.

942
00:44:54,322 --> 00:44:56,081
When we met again in Jingzhou,

943
00:44:56,442 --> 00:44:57,721
she told me she was married.

944
00:44:58,121 --> 00:44:59,161
The way she said it

945
00:44:59,201 --> 00:45:00,482
was overflowing

946
00:45:00,802 --> 00:45:01,922
with happiness.

947
00:45:02,922 --> 00:45:03,962
The radiance

948
00:45:05,121 --> 00:45:06,161
on her face

949
00:45:07,561 --> 00:45:09,081
was something I'd never seen.

950
00:45:09,922 --> 00:45:10,641
Really?

951
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:11,681
You got married?

952
00:45:15,241 --> 00:45:15,922
Yes, last month.

953
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:18,962
Though it's a bit late,

954
00:45:20,201 --> 00:45:21,081
congratulations.

955
00:45:22,842 --> 00:45:24,762
I could tell she was truly happy then.

956
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:26,882
It's all my fault.

957
00:45:27,402 --> 00:45:29,121
I've always been slow

958
00:45:29,121 --> 00:45:30,402
to express myself.

959
00:45:31,442 --> 00:45:32,681
Always realize things too late.

960
00:45:33,922 --> 00:45:34,922
You think you're alone?

961
00:45:38,521 --> 00:45:39,521
I'm the same.

962
00:45:40,002 --> 00:45:41,402
After I met Qiao Lin again,

963
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,561
she's always by my side,

964
00:45:45,561 --> 00:45:46,402
supporting,

965
00:45:47,241 --> 00:45:48,081
encouraging,

966
00:45:49,842 --> 00:45:50,641
and caring.

967
00:45:54,442 --> 00:45:55,922
And it still takes me so long

968
00:45:57,201 --> 00:45:58,601
to realize that I like her.

969
00:46:05,802 --> 00:46:06,762
Let's team up.

970
00:46:07,641 --> 00:46:09,362
The women we love are sisters.

971
00:46:10,482 --> 00:46:11,442
Our love lives

972
00:46:12,721 --> 00:46:14,161
are just as bumpy.

973
00:46:15,201 --> 00:46:16,282
We need to help each other.

974
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:17,762
Makes sense.

975
00:46:17,962 --> 00:46:18,882
When Lin ignores me,

976
00:46:19,442 --> 00:46:20,521
you can reach her for me.

977
00:46:20,842 --> 00:46:21,922
When Xu Yan avoids you,

978
00:46:22,521 --> 00:46:23,842
I can speak to her.

979
00:46:24,161 --> 00:46:24,882
That's...

980
00:46:26,561 --> 00:46:27,482
strength in numbers.

981
00:46:28,282 --> 00:46:29,962
Two are better than one.

982
00:46:30,322 --> 00:46:31,121
You're right.

983
00:46:31,802 --> 00:46:32,464
Brother-in-law.

984
00:46:32,882 --> 00:46:33,520
Brother-in-law.

985
00:46:35,442 --> 00:46:36,176
Brother-in-law.

986
00:46:36,402 --> 00:46:37,072
