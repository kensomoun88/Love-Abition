Did you talk to me just now?

I didn't hear it.

00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:11,642
Could you repeat that?

00:02:11,642 --> 00:02:12,403
Sorry.

37
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:14,363
Haochen.

38

Say it again, please.

Grandma.

Did you hear that?

43
00:02:23,202 --> 00:02:24,683
Haochen spoke to me!

44
00:02:24,803 --> 00:02:25,803
I heard it.

45
00:02:25,843 --> 00:02:27,123
My ears work fine.

46
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:29,202
Why are you so excited?

Thank you.

48

Don't mention it.

49
00:02:31,283 --> 00:02:33,602
He is very smart.

50
00:02:33,642 --> 00:02:34,602
He knows exactly

51
00:02:34,642 --> 00:02:36,083
who treats him well.

52
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:38,123
This is his first step forward.

53
00:02:39,123 --> 00:02:40,083
Thank you, Grandma.

54
00:02:40,762 --> 00:02:42,123
For what?

55
00:02:42,482 --> 00:02:44,963
Your care is all that matters.

56
00:02:45,762 --> 00:02:46,602
Thank you.

57
00:02:48,363 --> 00:02:49,083
Haochen.

58
00:02:49,482 --> 00:02:50,283
Temperature's okay?

59
00:02:50,283 --> 00:02:51,683
I'll adjust it for you, okay?

60
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,363
Need me to scrub your back?

61
00:02:54,003 --> 00:02:55,123
Tell me if you need help.

62
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:56,563
I'll stay right here.

63
00:02:57,162 --> 00:02:58,042
I won't move at all.

64
00:02:58,642 --> 00:02:59,403
Right here.

65
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:02,762
Haochen.

66
00:03:08,123 --> 00:03:08,963
It's ready.

67
00:03:09,963 --> 00:03:10,442
Here.

68
00:03:12,123 --> 00:03:13,162
Is it chilled?

69
00:03:14,003 --> 00:03:15,803
Of course. It's very sweet.

70
00:03:15,882 --> 00:03:16,523
Try it.

71
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:28,083
How's Dad been lately?

72
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:30,922
Mom said

73
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:32,283
he is doing fine.

74
00:03:34,762 --> 00:03:35,363
Good then.

75
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:38,202
Did you tell Mom

76
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:38,922
the good news

77
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,083
that Haochen talks now?

78
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:41,602
Yes.

79
00:03:42,403 --> 00:03:43,363
She's thrilled.

80
00:03:45,482 --> 00:03:46,482
I really hope Haochen

81
00:03:46,482 --> 00:03:48,123
can recover sooner to his former

82
00:03:48,243 --> 00:03:49,403
lively and playful self.

83
00:03:50,442 --> 00:03:51,003
He will.

84
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:53,563
Just give him more time.

85
00:03:55,482 --> 00:03:57,123
I've told Dr. Wang about

86
00:03:57,202 --> 00:03:58,442
Haochen's recent progress.

87
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:01,523
Dr. Wang said it's excellent.

88
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:03,722
This shows

89
00:04:04,403 --> 00:04:06,003
Grandma's methods really work.

90
00:04:06,882 --> 00:04:07,363
Right?

91
00:04:11,322 --> 00:04:12,602
Actually, I've always thought

92
00:04:13,322 --> 00:04:14,162
Grandma is

93
00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:15,563
an exceptionally wise person.

94
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:17,642
She's attentive

95
00:04:18,683 --> 00:04:20,123
and great at caring for children,

96
00:04:20,442 --> 00:04:21,163
even

97
00:04:21,163 --> 00:04:22,163
playing along with them.

98
00:04:24,082 --> 00:04:24,522
Wherever

99
00:04:24,522 --> 00:04:25,762
Grandma is present,

100
00:04:26,803 --> 00:04:28,123
I feel completely at ease.

101
00:04:30,882 --> 00:04:31,842
Grandma is

102
00:04:31,842 --> 00:04:33,322
your steadfast anchor.

103
00:04:34,563 --> 00:04:35,603
And you are

104
00:04:35,603 --> 00:04:37,082
my steadfast anchor.

105
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:43,003
Why suddenly say

106
00:04:43,003 --> 00:04:44,003
such cheesy things?

107
00:04:45,563 --> 00:04:47,043
I saw your photo album

108
00:04:47,642 --> 00:04:48,683
in your room today.

109
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,243
Or rather,

110
00:04:51,363 --> 00:04:52,522
our photo album.

111
00:04:56,043 --> 00:04:57,842
How did you find that?

112
00:05:02,483 --> 00:05:03,842
The album

113
00:05:04,322 --> 00:05:06,603
ends when we were splitting up.

114
00:05:08,563 --> 00:05:09,642
I'm so glad

115
00:05:10,363 --> 00:05:12,123
we can take more photos together.

116
00:05:31,803 --> 00:05:32,882
Why take photos now?

117
00:05:34,923 --> 00:05:36,442
I want to add this photo

118
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:37,882
to the album

119
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:40,442
as our new page.

120
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:42,363
Then I'll write

121
00:05:42,402 --> 00:05:44,923
"Today's watermelon was sweet."

122
00:05:58,762 --> 00:06:00,282
We have to keep recording.

123
00:06:01,082 --> 00:06:02,642
Even when we grow old,

124
00:06:03,082 --> 00:06:04,202
we will

125
00:06:05,363 --> 00:06:06,483
admire the moon here

126
00:06:06,962 --> 00:06:08,442
with endless things to talk about.

127
00:06:10,882 --> 00:06:12,123
Now I finally understand

128
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:13,842
what mutual devotion really means.

129
00:06:14,563 --> 00:06:15,322
Do you know?

130
00:06:16,483 --> 00:06:17,282
It's like

131
00:06:18,282 --> 00:06:19,123
you imagine,

132
00:06:19,282 --> 00:06:20,043
and I do along.

133
00:06:24,962 --> 00:06:26,003
Want more watermelon?

134
00:06:26,322 --> 00:06:26,803
Okay.

135
00:06:32,123 --> 00:06:33,563
The moon is bright tonight.

136
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,043
Look.

137
00:06:46,842 --> 00:06:47,483
Look.

138
00:06:56,563 --> 00:06:58,243
You've all heard the news, right?

139
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,043
In real estate circles,

140
00:07:01,282 --> 00:07:03,043
there's been
a major development recently.

141
00:07:05,003 --> 00:07:07,043
The North Waichuan area in East China.

142
00:07:07,642 --> 00:07:08,603
You're interested in it?

143
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:10,003
This will be

144
00:07:10,603 --> 00:07:11,603
my first major project

145
00:07:11,603 --> 00:07:12,642
since taking over Jinda.

146
00:07:13,762 --> 00:07:14,603
Only obtaining

147
00:07:14,603 --> 00:07:16,043
such achievements

148
00:07:17,483 --> 00:07:20,003
will silence the skeptics.

149
00:07:20,202 --> 00:07:20,803
Mr. Qu.

150
00:07:21,243 --> 00:07:22,522
I'll support you

151
00:07:22,762 --> 00:07:23,522
and give it my all.

152
00:07:25,603 --> 00:07:26,402
Weiping.

153
00:07:27,642 --> 00:07:28,882
How are Shen Haoming

154
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:30,563
and Shen Jinsong?

155
00:07:31,402 --> 00:07:32,082
Godfather.

156
00:07:32,723 --> 00:07:33,762
Shen Haoming

157
00:07:33,762 --> 00:07:34,842
has left Jingzhou

158
00:07:34,842 --> 00:07:35,842
with Xu Yan and the child

159
00:07:36,282 --> 00:07:37,683
to lie low somewhere.

160
00:07:38,363 --> 00:07:39,603
And Shen Jinsong remains

161
00:07:39,603 --> 00:07:40,762
in a coma.

162
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:45,723
Mr. Qu.

163
00:07:46,923 --> 00:07:48,683
Do you think

164
00:07:49,003 --> 00:07:50,320
Shen Haoming

165
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,152
can make a comeback?

166
00:07:53,003 --> 00:07:54,522
I believe he

167
00:07:54,563 --> 00:07:55,483
would never abandon

168
00:07:55,483 --> 00:07:56,842
this Diamond Plot.

169
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:00,483
Monitor closely

170
00:08:01,123 --> 00:08:02,442
who he associates with.

171
00:08:16,723 --> 00:08:17,322
Tired?

172
00:08:18,522 --> 00:08:19,363
Want some water?

173
00:08:21,842 --> 00:08:22,803
This won't work.

174
00:08:23,363 --> 00:08:24,082
Use mine.

175
00:08:36,003 --> 00:08:36,682
Haochen.

176
00:08:37,363 --> 00:08:38,723
Grandma's cooking is delicious.

177
00:08:38,723 --> 00:08:39,483
Lunch is ready.

178
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:41,682
Alright.

179
00:08:47,562 --> 00:08:48,162
Ignore me.

180
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:52,922
Take a break.

181
00:08:58,363 --> 00:08:59,682
You've prepared the soil so well.

182
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:01,762
The seeds in this patch

183
00:09:01,762 --> 00:09:03,603
will surely thrive better than others.

184
00:09:11,282 --> 00:09:12,323
He talks to you.

185
00:09:13,443 --> 00:09:14,443
Yet you still ignore him?

186
00:09:16,003 --> 00:09:17,243
Not even saving face for him?

187
00:09:18,843 --> 00:09:20,443
Dad isn't my real dad.

188
00:09:20,922 --> 00:09:22,243
Mom isn't my real mom.

189
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:24,363
Brother isn't my real brother.

190
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:26,963
I'm not even my true self.

191
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:30,603
I don't know what to say.

192
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,762
I just don't understand

193
00:09:36,562 --> 00:09:38,363
why he had to deceive me.

194
00:09:40,203 --> 00:09:41,882
Why didn't he acknowledge me?

195
00:09:44,762 --> 00:09:45,522
Haochen.

196
00:09:45,922 --> 00:09:47,123
Have you considered

197
00:09:48,882 --> 00:09:50,243
that back then, Shen Haoming

198
00:09:50,243 --> 00:09:51,562
was just a kid himself?

199
00:09:53,203 --> 00:09:54,003
When he accidentally

200
00:09:54,003 --> 00:09:54,963
learned he had a son,

201
00:09:55,323 --> 00:09:56,443
he was scared too.

202
00:09:56,802 --> 00:09:58,162
But he never considered

203
00:09:58,162 --> 00:09:58,963
abandoning you.

204
00:10:00,522 --> 00:10:01,642
He wanted to protect you.

205
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:07,162
Of course,

206
00:10:08,203 --> 00:10:09,282
Haoming's dad

207
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,282
also wanted to protect his son,

208
00:10:12,642 --> 00:10:14,443
so used a wrong way.

209
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:17,522
However, their purposes

210
00:10:17,922 --> 00:10:19,243
were to protect you.

211
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:22,083
Do you understand me?

212
00:10:27,162 --> 00:10:28,843
But he's deceived me.

213
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:30,203
Exactly.

214
00:10:30,682 --> 00:10:32,203
He's deceived you.

215
00:10:32,682 --> 00:10:33,882
And it is wrong.

216
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:35,682
Lies

217
00:10:35,723 --> 00:10:37,162
will eventually come to light.

218
00:10:37,562 --> 00:10:38,162
Everyone

219
00:10:38,162 --> 00:10:39,522
will pay the price for this.

220
00:10:41,762 --> 00:10:43,042
They're upset too.

221
00:10:47,042 --> 00:10:48,843
Whoever you are,

222
00:10:48,843 --> 00:10:49,963
in this family,

223
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,642
they'd always love you deeply,

224
00:10:53,603 --> 00:10:54,963
and their love will never change.

225
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,083
I know you can feel it,

226
00:10:59,562 --> 00:11:00,203
right?

227
00:11:04,323 --> 00:11:05,443
So I have to

228
00:11:05,443 --> 00:11:06,483
forgive them?

229
00:11:06,682 --> 00:11:07,522
Of course not.

230
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:10,562
You can have your own decision.

231
00:11:11,522 --> 00:11:13,123
It's all up to you.

232
00:11:13,402 --> 00:11:14,802
You can do whatever you want.

233
00:11:17,483 --> 00:11:19,083
I just want to remind you

234
00:11:20,603 --> 00:11:21,922
that we all love you very much.

235
00:11:24,843 --> 00:11:26,123
This will never change.

236
00:11:27,282 --> 00:11:28,522
I believe you can understand.

237
00:11:31,802 --> 00:11:32,243
Really.

238
00:11:32,243 --> 00:11:33,603
Grandma's cooking is delicious.

239
00:11:33,882 --> 00:11:34,603
Potato!

240
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:37,802
Let's go

241
00:11:38,203 --> 00:11:39,003
to have lunch.

242
00:11:40,483 --> 00:11:41,003
Let's go.

243
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:45,963
Look at the potato.

244
00:11:47,922 --> 00:11:49,282
Freshly dug from the ground.

245
00:12:44,522 --> 00:12:45,083
Hello.

246
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:46,843
Where's the convenience store?

247
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:47,682
What?

248
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:48,922
It's not close.

249
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:50,323
Keep walking along

250
00:12:50,323 --> 00:12:51,203
this road.

251
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:52,882
Then you'll reach a fork.

252
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:53,723
Turn left there.

253
00:12:53,762 --> 00:12:54,483
Walk along.

254
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:55,642
Turn right at the next fork.

255
00:12:55,843 --> 00:12:57,363
Walk about 500 meters more,

256
00:12:57,522 --> 00:12:58,802
you'll see that.

257
00:12:59,922 --> 00:13:01,483
Turn left first, then right.

258
00:13:01,522 --> 00:13:02,083
Exactly.

259
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:02,682
Thank you.

260
00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:03,483
No problem.

261
00:13:12,882 --> 00:13:13,402
Haochen.

262
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,619
(Hongxin Zhenyuan
Supermarket and Restaurant)

263
00:13:56,882 --> 00:13:57,483
Haochen!

264
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:00,802
Haochen!

265
00:14:04,682 --> 00:14:05,243
Haochen!

266
00:14:18,562 --> 00:14:19,123
Haochen!

267
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:20,802
I'm here.

268
00:14:24,042 --> 00:14:24,723
At midnight,

269
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,003
why did you

270
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:26,843
come out

271
00:14:28,843 --> 00:14:29,723
without telling me?

272
00:14:31,483 --> 00:14:32,723
I was so worried about you.

273
00:14:35,843 --> 00:14:36,723
Are you hurt?

274
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:42,042
Hungry?

275
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:44,802
Tell me then.

276
00:14:45,682 --> 00:14:46,522
I'll cook for you.

277
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:49,203
Are you cold?

278
00:14:50,363 --> 00:14:51,363
You're sweating.

279
00:14:51,963 --> 00:14:52,922
Might catch a cold.

280
00:14:53,922 --> 00:14:54,723
Don't get chilled.

281
00:15:49,603 --> 00:15:50,363
Enough hangers?

282
00:15:51,162 --> 00:15:51,682
Yes.

283
00:15:53,843 --> 00:15:54,363
Grandma.

284
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:57,642
Haoming and I decided

285
00:15:58,003 --> 00:15:59,522
to return to Jingzhou tomorrow.

286
00:16:00,963 --> 00:16:02,162
So soon?

287
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:06,843
Haochen is getting better,

288
00:16:08,282 --> 00:16:09,282
but Haoming's dad

289
00:16:09,282 --> 00:16:10,123
is hospitalized.

290
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:12,323
So we thought

291
00:16:12,963 --> 00:16:14,003
to get back soon.

292
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:17,522
Hasn't he awoken yet?

293
00:16:19,483 --> 00:16:20,282
Not yet.

294
00:16:21,603 --> 00:16:23,802
Although his vitals are stable,

295
00:16:24,363 --> 00:16:25,723
he just hasn't awoken.

296
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:30,162
Go back then.

297
00:16:30,802 --> 00:16:31,843
When people are ill,

298
00:16:32,162 --> 00:16:33,243
they need family

299
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,443
the most.

300
00:16:36,123 --> 00:16:36,963
Tomorrow morning,

301
00:16:37,003 --> 00:16:38,083
I'll pack your luggage.

302
00:16:52,522 --> 00:16:54,282
I've told you many times

303
00:16:55,243 --> 00:16:56,203
to bring you to Jingzhou

304
00:16:56,203 --> 00:16:57,522
to take good care

305
00:16:57,682 --> 00:16:58,642
of you.

306
00:17:01,243 --> 00:17:02,162
Now,

307
00:17:03,203 --> 00:17:04,282
when trouble comes,

308
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:06,762
we still need your care.

309
00:17:08,082 --> 00:17:09,562
Don't you remember?

310
00:17:10,082 --> 00:17:12,522
I'm your safe harbor.

311
00:17:13,443 --> 00:17:14,243
Yan.

312
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:15,842
No matter

313
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,163
what trouble or worries

314
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:19,243
you have,

315
00:17:19,562 --> 00:17:21,562
you can always come home to me.

316
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:24,522
I'll always be here for you.

317
00:17:33,203 --> 00:17:34,723
When we settle everything,

318
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:37,042
I'll bring Haochen to visit again.

319
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:39,362
That would make me so happy.

320
00:17:47,203 --> 00:17:47,683
Okay.

321
00:17:48,723 --> 00:17:49,203
Come on.

322
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:49,883
Here.

323
00:17:52,762 --> 00:17:54,003
- I'll do it.
- It's soaked.

324
00:17:54,003 --> 00:17:54,723
Wring it dry.

325
00:17:55,243 --> 00:17:56,082
Take it.

326
00:17:56,322 --> 00:17:57,163
Yes, like that.

327
00:17:57,403 --> 00:17:58,443
Use both hands.

328
00:17:59,362 --> 00:18:00,003
Oh my!

329
00:18:00,243 --> 00:18:00,522
Come.

330
00:18:00,602 --> 00:18:01,203
Yes, yes.

331
00:18:02,003 --> 00:18:02,842
Okay. Wring it dry.

332
00:18:08,986 --> 00:18:10,842
(Yan Studio)

333
00:18:10,842 --> 00:18:11,963
Welcome back, Ms. Xu.

334
00:18:11,963 --> 00:18:13,403
Yan, I miss you so much.

335
00:18:13,403 --> 00:18:14,163
That's enough.

336
00:18:14,163 --> 00:18:15,082
Have a seat.

337
00:18:15,723 --> 00:18:16,322
Sit, sit.

338
00:18:17,562 --> 00:18:18,163
Recently,

339
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:20,602
due to my personal matters,

340
00:18:21,282 --> 00:18:22,562
I've delayed the progress.

341
00:18:23,122 --> 00:18:24,163
But thanks to Lin

342
00:18:24,483 --> 00:18:25,522
and your efforts,

343
00:18:25,762 --> 00:18:27,483
Yan Studio is now operating smoothly.

344
00:18:29,322 --> 00:18:30,443
I especially want to thank

345
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:32,122
our CFO Lin Tao,

346
00:18:32,923 --> 00:18:34,483
who secured the bank loan

347
00:18:34,923 --> 00:18:35,802
for Yan Studio,

348
00:18:35,802 --> 00:18:36,963
solving our urgent needs.

349
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:37,683
Thank you.

350
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:40,842
I just did my job.

351
00:18:41,122 --> 00:18:42,923
It's all due to Ms. Qiao's leadership.

352
00:18:45,243 --> 00:18:46,163
Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

353
00:18:46,723 --> 00:18:47,203
Alright.

354
00:18:47,842 --> 00:18:48,243
Okay.

355
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:49,163
Let's begin then.

356
00:18:49,163 --> 00:18:50,483
Tell me

357
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:51,923
the recent project progress.

358
00:18:52,643 --> 00:18:53,082
Yao,

359
00:18:53,122 --> 00:18:54,522
about the batik project,

360
00:18:54,522 --> 00:18:55,163
now...

361
00:18:55,443 --> 00:18:56,282
I've prepared

362
00:18:56,282 --> 00:18:57,802
a plan for the batik collection.

363
00:18:57,883 --> 00:18:58,403
Take a look.

364
00:18:59,522 --> 00:19:00,762
For the new products,

365
00:19:00,802 --> 00:19:02,082
we'll collaborate with

366
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:04,203
top ten fashion influencers

367
00:19:04,203 --> 00:19:05,403
for videos.

368
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:06,443
It's almost done.

369
00:19:11,003 --> 00:19:12,322
So he falsified

370
00:19:12,322 --> 00:19:14,384
Yan Studio's

371
00:19:14,384 --> 00:19:15,084
financial reports

372
00:19:15,842 --> 00:19:17,003
and applied for the loan.

373
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:18,723
All to force you

374
00:19:19,562 --> 00:19:21,443
to return and marry him?

375
00:19:23,683 --> 00:19:24,362
That's why

376
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:26,003
you moved out, right?

377
00:19:28,443 --> 00:19:30,643
I wanted to keep him calm.

378
00:19:31,322 --> 00:19:33,322
That meant keeping distance

379
00:19:33,522 --> 00:19:35,042
from Yu Yiming temporarily.

380
00:19:39,203 --> 00:19:40,683
Earlier,

381
00:19:41,322 --> 00:19:42,403
he acted diligent

382
00:19:42,883 --> 00:19:44,003
and reliable,

383
00:19:44,003 --> 00:19:45,003
but it was all an act.

384
00:19:45,082 --> 00:19:46,322
He planned all this

385
00:19:46,322 --> 00:19:47,522
long ago, right?

386
00:19:51,282 --> 00:19:52,163
Recently,

387
00:19:52,163 --> 00:19:53,403
I've been thinking

388
00:19:53,522 --> 00:19:55,042
how to handle this.

389
00:19:56,723 --> 00:19:57,762
I've recorded evidence.

390
00:20:00,082 --> 00:20:01,163
I confronted him

391
00:20:01,163 --> 00:20:03,443
and recorded this.

392
00:20:03,443 --> 00:20:04,003
Hear it out.

393
00:20:04,762 --> 00:20:06,163
When did I falsify the accounts?

394
00:20:06,802 --> 00:20:08,203
If you're accusing me of that,

395
00:20:08,723 --> 00:20:09,883
you stamped the seal!

396
00:20:10,203 --> 00:20:10,683
Yes,

397
00:20:11,602 --> 00:20:12,322
I admit

398
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:14,562
threatening you with loan fraud

399
00:20:14,683 --> 00:20:15,923
was despicable,

400
00:20:16,802 --> 00:20:18,243
but my love for you

401
00:20:18,243 --> 00:20:19,522
is genuine.

402
00:20:20,483 --> 00:20:22,483
I never meant to harm anyone.

403
00:20:23,762 --> 00:20:25,602
I just want you to come back with me.

404
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,842
With this recording,

405
00:20:31,122 --> 00:20:32,923
we can at least prove to the bank

406
00:20:32,923 --> 00:20:34,443
that we aren't part of his scheme.

407
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:35,683
And we didn't know

408
00:20:35,683 --> 00:20:36,683
about the loan fraud,

409
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,042
nor involved in it.

410
00:20:39,883 --> 00:20:42,362
We've used part of the loan,

411
00:20:42,963 --> 00:20:44,362
but fortunately not much.

412
00:20:45,883 --> 00:20:47,403
I told parents

413
00:20:47,683 --> 00:20:49,082
we're facing

414
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,203
the cash flow problem.

415
00:20:50,923 --> 00:20:51,723
Then they gave us

416
00:20:51,923 --> 00:20:53,122
the pension money

417
00:20:53,122 --> 00:20:54,362
you gave them.

418
00:20:55,243 --> 00:20:56,723
Now the money is ready.

419
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,163
We can repay the bank anytime.

420
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:02,883
I'm sorry, Yan.

421
00:21:03,082 --> 00:21:04,443
You entrusted me with the company,

422
00:21:04,522 --> 00:21:05,883
and I caused this mess.

423
00:21:06,762 --> 00:21:08,243
This isn't your fault.

424
00:21:09,163 --> 00:21:09,842
Besides,

425
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:11,003
you got the evidence.

426
00:21:11,163 --> 00:21:12,362
You've done great enough.

427
00:21:14,883 --> 00:21:15,443
By the way,

428
00:21:15,923 --> 00:21:17,403
you mentioned

429
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:18,923
that Lin Tao raised

430
00:21:18,963 --> 00:21:20,243
the profit margin to 21 percent,

431
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:21,403
to let us get the loan?

432
00:21:21,963 --> 00:21:22,403
Yes.

433
00:21:22,963 --> 00:21:24,643
Given our high-cost

434
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:25,762
handmade fabrics,

435
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:27,522
and the enormous expenses

436
00:21:27,522 --> 00:21:28,483
for promotion,

437
00:21:29,403 --> 00:21:30,282
our company

438
00:21:30,282 --> 00:21:31,483
is in a phase

439
00:21:31,643 --> 00:21:33,883
of seeking the break-even point.

440
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:37,762
It's impossible to achieve

441
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:39,082
a 21 percent profit margin.

442
00:21:40,802 --> 00:21:42,443
How could the bank miss this?

443
00:21:43,683 --> 00:21:45,403
The loan officer Feng

444
00:21:45,403 --> 00:21:46,723
is Lin Tao's close friend.

445
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:47,082
Also...

446
00:21:47,082 --> 00:21:48,082
That is not plausible.

447
00:21:48,963 --> 00:21:50,762
Loan fraud is illegal
and leads to jail time.

448
00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:54,003
Would this Feng

449
00:21:54,082 --> 00:21:55,163
really take

450
00:21:55,443 --> 00:21:56,883
such huge risks

451
00:21:57,362 --> 00:21:58,723
just to help Lin Tao?

452
00:22:01,522 --> 00:22:02,842
Even if there were oversights

453
00:22:02,842 --> 00:22:03,723
in the review process,

454
00:22:04,243 --> 00:22:06,483
both staff and supervisors

455
00:22:06,562 --> 00:22:08,122
would face severe legal liabilities.

456
00:22:08,282 --> 00:22:09,082
In this regard,

457
00:22:09,683 --> 00:22:11,282
banks would be extremely cautious.

458
00:22:13,802 --> 00:22:15,282
This is suspicious.

459
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:17,562
In that case,

460
00:22:19,203 --> 00:22:20,923
there is something off.

461
00:22:21,362 --> 00:22:21,883
(Manager's Office)
Ms. Qiao,

462
00:22:22,322 --> 00:22:22,923
Lin Tao

463
00:22:22,923 --> 00:22:24,403
has handled the documents.

464
00:22:24,522 --> 00:22:26,762
Just stamp here.

465
00:22:27,082 --> 00:22:27,683
Feng,

466
00:22:28,003 --> 00:22:30,243
thank you for the loan.

467
00:22:31,003 --> 00:22:31,802
(Loan Contract)
Don't worry.

468
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:32,723
Tao and I

469
00:22:32,723 --> 00:22:33,602
are old friends.

470
00:22:33,963 --> 00:22:35,322
We'll proceed

471
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,443
at the fastest pace.

472
00:22:36,683 --> 00:22:37,723
Thank you.

473
00:22:38,082 --> 00:22:39,122
Truly a lifesaver.

474
00:22:39,203 --> 00:22:40,003
(Party B: Jingzhou Yan Studio Fashion Design Co., Ltd.)
It's nothing.

475
00:22:40,122 --> 00:22:41,082
This should be okay.

476
00:22:41,483 --> 00:22:42,643
Once the funds are released,

477
00:22:42,963 --> 00:22:43,963
I'll notify you.

478
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:44,802
Feng,

479
00:22:44,842 --> 00:22:46,362
when do you finish work today?

480
00:22:46,923 --> 00:22:48,562
Let's have dinner together tonight.

481
00:22:49,322 --> 00:22:49,602
I...

482
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:50,042
Ms. Qiao.

483
00:22:50,683 --> 00:22:52,082
I've booked our return tickets.

484
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:53,483
We need to leave tonight.

485
00:22:53,643 --> 00:22:55,003
Next time then.

486
00:22:55,362 --> 00:22:56,723
Now that we've connected,

487
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,082
there'll be many opportunities.

488
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,082
Next time then.

489
00:23:04,122 --> 00:23:04,723
So Lin Tao

490
00:23:04,723 --> 00:23:06,122
didn't want you

491
00:23:06,643 --> 00:23:07,602
to contact

492
00:23:07,602 --> 00:23:08,923
that Feng.

493
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:11,282
Now,

494
00:23:11,562 --> 00:23:12,243
the top priority

495
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:13,963
is to find Feng

496
00:23:14,203 --> 00:23:15,322
and figure out

497
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:16,802
what's happening

498
00:23:16,802 --> 00:23:17,562
with this loan.

499
00:23:18,602 --> 00:23:19,163
Besides,

500
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:20,762
I know you don't want

501
00:23:21,403 --> 00:23:22,683
Yu Yiming involved,

502
00:23:23,923 --> 00:23:25,003
but this matter

503
00:23:25,562 --> 00:23:26,762
has nothing to do

504
00:23:26,883 --> 00:23:28,042
with your relationship.

505
00:23:29,648 --> 00:23:30,832
I think

506
00:23:30,832 --> 00:23:32,163
you should be honest with him.

507
00:23:35,842 --> 00:23:36,683
Anyway,

508
00:23:37,122 --> 00:23:39,042
that's how it is.

509
00:23:43,403 --> 00:23:44,562
I know...

510
00:23:45,082 --> 00:23:46,602
I know you'd be upset.

511
00:23:57,042 --> 00:23:58,403
You didn't tell me

512
00:23:59,362 --> 00:24:00,522
because you feared Lin Tao

513
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,092
would escalate things and implicate me.

514
00:24:03,762 --> 00:24:05,282
You've been bearing

515
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:07,602
all this alone recently.

516
00:24:10,723 --> 00:24:11,602
But from now on,

517
00:24:12,403 --> 00:24:13,842
no matter what happens,

518
00:24:14,082 --> 00:24:15,923
whether it's big or small,

519
00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:18,042
you have to tell me.

520
00:24:24,842 --> 00:24:26,643
I plan to visit my hometown

521
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:27,802
to find Feng

522
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:29,923
and see if I can figure out this.

523
00:24:30,403 --> 00:24:30,842
Alright.

524
00:24:31,082 --> 00:24:31,842
I'll go with you.

525
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:33,322
No need. I can go by myself.

526
00:24:33,362 --> 00:24:33,923
No way.

527
00:24:34,883 --> 00:24:36,042
What if Feng is colluding

528
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:36,842
with Lin Tao?

529
00:24:37,883 --> 00:24:39,322
What if something happens?

530
00:24:40,683 --> 00:24:42,203
I must go with you.

531
00:24:44,042 --> 00:24:44,602
Alright.

532
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,522
(Yan Studio)

533
00:24:51,522 --> 00:24:52,522
Currently,

534
00:24:52,602 --> 00:24:54,203
apart from our production line's

535
00:24:54,203 --> 00:24:55,282
steady output,

536
00:24:55,643 --> 00:24:56,282
I want you all

537
00:24:56,282 --> 00:24:57,723
to focus on

538
00:24:57,723 --> 00:24:58,483
pushing forward

539
00:24:58,483 --> 00:24:59,963
with the physical store expansion.

540
00:25:00,282 --> 00:25:01,562
Four key points to note.

541
00:25:02,003 --> 00:25:02,562
First,

542
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:04,243
window display designs.

543
00:25:04,683 --> 00:25:05,082
Second,

544
00:25:05,163 --> 00:25:06,562
pre-launch marketing campaigns.

545
00:25:07,003 --> 00:25:07,602
Third,

546
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,082
staff service training.

547
00:25:09,122 --> 00:25:09,683
Fourth,

548
00:25:10,082 --> 00:25:11,163
supply chain reliability.

549
00:25:11,522 --> 00:25:12,362
All departments must

550
00:25:12,362 --> 00:25:13,282
offer timely feedback.

551
00:25:13,483 --> 00:25:14,643
Besides,

552
00:25:15,322 --> 00:25:16,322
there will be

553
00:25:16,322 --> 00:25:17,562
more staff.

554
00:25:17,723 --> 00:25:18,762
If you need anything,

555
00:25:18,762 --> 00:25:20,282
inform HR.

556
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:23,562
Qiao Lin,

557
00:25:24,443 --> 00:25:25,163
a mall in Tianjin

558
00:25:25,163 --> 00:25:26,122
invites us to set up

559
00:25:26,122 --> 00:25:28,082
a physical store there.

560
00:25:29,003 --> 00:25:29,562
This is

561
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:30,443
a good opportunity.

562
00:25:30,842 --> 00:25:32,003
You'll go discuss

563
00:25:32,003 --> 00:25:33,042
the details thoroughly.

564
00:25:33,362 --> 00:25:33,762
Okay.

565
00:25:34,322 --> 00:25:35,082
Mr. Lin.

566
00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:37,042
We're pushing forward

567
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:38,643
with the physical store project,

568
00:25:38,683 --> 00:25:39,842
so the financial work

569
00:25:39,842 --> 00:25:40,522
will increase.

570
00:25:40,522 --> 00:25:41,243
Please handle it.

571
00:25:41,762 --> 00:25:42,923
I'm glad

572
00:25:42,963 --> 00:25:44,362
that the company is thriving.

573
00:25:46,802 --> 00:25:47,522
Please compile

574
00:25:47,522 --> 00:25:49,003
the budgets of all departments

575
00:25:49,003 --> 00:25:50,403
and put them in my office.

576
00:25:50,562 --> 00:25:51,082
I want

577
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:52,322
our petty cash reserve

578
00:25:52,322 --> 00:25:53,443
adjusted to three percent.

579
00:25:53,522 --> 00:25:54,203
No problem.

580
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:57,723
On Wednesday,

581
00:25:58,602 --> 00:25:59,643
I'll discuss it with you.

582
00:26:00,443 --> 00:26:00,883
Okay.

583
00:26:03,082 --> 00:26:03,562
Okay.

584
00:26:03,723 --> 00:26:04,802
Please state

585
00:26:04,802 --> 00:26:06,042
your budgets.

586
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:07,403
Lin Tao, take notes.

587
00:26:08,643 --> 00:26:09,163
Huanhuan,

588
00:26:09,282 --> 00:26:10,322
what's the biggest expense

589
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:11,963
in promotion?

590
00:26:12,122 --> 00:26:12,923
It's mainly about

591
00:26:12,923 --> 00:26:14,282
KOL collaborations

592
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:15,762
and organizing offline events.

593
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:17,483
We plan to launch

594
00:26:17,483 --> 00:26:19,243
a physical store check-in campaign,

595
00:26:19,602 --> 00:26:21,042
posting featuring Yan Studio...

596
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,122
(Yan Studio)

597
00:26:27,122 --> 00:26:27,723
What's wrong?

598
00:26:27,802 --> 00:26:28,602
What's the matter?

599
00:26:34,322 --> 00:26:35,602
When will you return?

600
00:26:37,403 --> 00:26:38,683
I'll go early tomorrow

601
00:26:38,762 --> 00:26:40,082
and have a dinner.

602
00:26:40,176 --> 00:26:40,842
I will be back

603
00:26:40,842 --> 00:26:42,042
by the morning after next.

604
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:43,443
Don't worry.

605
00:26:43,443 --> 00:26:44,963
It won't delay our trip back home.

606
00:26:47,683 --> 00:26:49,403
Now that the company is back on track,

607
00:26:50,122 --> 00:26:51,362
and everything goes smoothly,

608
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:52,883
I must keep

609
00:26:53,122 --> 00:26:54,923
my promise.

610
00:26:58,923 --> 00:26:59,562
I know.

611
00:27:00,802 --> 00:27:02,163
I'm not pushing you.

612
00:27:06,203 --> 00:27:07,042
Enough talk.

613
00:27:08,042 --> 00:27:09,483
Time will prove everything.

614
00:27:31,403 --> 00:27:31,963
(Qiao Lin.)

615
00:27:32,282 --> 00:27:33,562
(Remember this place?)

616
00:27:34,122 --> 00:27:35,883
Where you asked me to dinner last time.

617
00:27:37,802 --> 00:27:39,403
I've prepared something special.

618
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:41,762
Balloons,

619
00:27:43,082 --> 00:27:43,963
flowers,

620
00:27:44,643 --> 00:27:45,403
and champagne.

621
00:27:47,522 --> 00:27:48,282
Most importantly,

622
00:27:50,042 --> 00:27:51,042
there's us two.

623
00:27:54,082 --> 00:27:55,122
Will you marry me?

624
00:27:56,163 --> 00:27:57,163
Yu Yiming?

625
00:27:59,602 --> 00:28:00,243
Lin.

626
00:28:00,883 --> 00:28:01,643
What's going on?

627
00:28:02,403 --> 00:28:03,683
Why do you bring him here?

628
00:28:07,522 --> 00:28:08,042
Lin.

629
00:28:08,163 --> 00:28:09,483
Look, I've bought the ring.

630
00:28:09,883 --> 00:28:11,483
Let's go back at 11 AM

631
00:28:11,762 --> 00:28:12,683
this Saturday

632
00:28:13,042 --> 00:28:13,322
to...

633
00:28:13,322 --> 00:28:14,643
Lin won't go back with you,

634
00:28:15,842 --> 00:28:16,963
nor will she marry you.

635
00:28:26,602 --> 00:28:27,443
Broke your promise?

636
00:28:27,923 --> 00:28:29,562
I've helped you.

637
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,322
Now you're backing out?

638
00:28:35,203 --> 00:28:36,762
Didn't I make myself clear?

639
00:28:37,963 --> 00:28:40,082
You should know the consequences.

640
00:28:42,443 --> 00:28:43,963
We know about the loan.

641
00:28:47,362 --> 00:28:48,883
You went to see Feng?

642
00:28:49,483 --> 00:28:50,562
You assumed

643
00:28:50,842 --> 00:28:51,762
that I would

644
00:28:51,762 --> 00:28:52,643
fear escalation.

645
00:28:53,723 --> 00:28:54,522
You also assumed

646
00:28:54,522 --> 00:28:56,122
that I wouldn't dare approach the bank.

647
00:28:57,163 --> 00:28:58,842
You thought

648
00:28:59,163 --> 00:29:00,122
we would

649
00:29:00,122 --> 00:29:01,243
accept this loan,

650
00:29:01,483 --> 00:29:02,522
make regular payments,

651
00:29:03,163 --> 00:29:05,003
and never mention it again.

652
00:29:05,322 --> 00:29:06,802
But how is that possible?

653
00:29:07,322 --> 00:29:08,723
If this were loan fraud,

654
00:29:09,042 --> 00:29:10,322
I'd face legal consequences

655
00:29:10,602 --> 00:29:12,522
because I stamped the seal

656
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,003
and it's my negligence.

657
00:29:14,362 --> 00:29:15,683
That's what I planned to do.

658
00:29:16,762 --> 00:29:18,082
When I met with Feng,

659
00:29:18,362 --> 00:29:19,723
I wanted to explain the situation,

660
00:29:19,723 --> 00:29:20,683
but then I discovered

661
00:29:21,282 --> 00:29:22,122
you never

662
00:29:22,122 --> 00:29:23,163
falsified the accounts.

663
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:24,163
You gave him

664
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:25,643
the authentic financial records,

665
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:27,082
so he approved the loan.

666
00:29:27,362 --> 00:29:28,163
So, you didn't

667
00:29:28,163 --> 00:29:29,203
want me to dine with him.

668
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:30,602
You lied to me,

669
00:29:30,842 --> 00:29:32,003
gave me fake reports,

670
00:29:32,122 --> 00:29:33,042
and made me stamp them,

671
00:29:33,562 --> 00:29:34,643
in order to get me back

672
00:29:34,643 --> 00:29:36,042
and marry you.

673
00:29:37,602 --> 00:29:38,322
Lin Tao.

674
00:29:38,802 --> 00:29:39,883
You had a conscience

675
00:29:40,082 --> 00:29:41,243
and didn't commit loan fraud.

676
00:29:42,122 --> 00:29:42,643
Otherwise,

677
00:29:42,643 --> 00:29:43,883
we'd be at the police station.

678
00:29:45,082 --> 00:29:46,122
I could sue you,

679
00:29:47,443 --> 00:29:49,042
but I want to show some mercy.

680
00:29:49,643 --> 00:29:53,443
So, please leave.

681
00:29:55,683 --> 00:29:56,403
Lin Tao.

682
00:29:57,082 --> 00:29:58,322
Stop all these schemes.

683
00:29:58,602 --> 00:29:59,883
Especially leave Qiao Lin alone.

684
00:30:01,443 --> 00:30:02,602
Or I won't let you off.

685
00:30:18,282 --> 00:30:20,403
Sir, should we serve the dishes?

686
00:30:20,883 --> 00:30:22,163
Get out!

687
00:30:30,483 --> 00:30:31,282
What?

688
00:30:43,602 --> 00:30:45,163
I've received the email.

689
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:46,963
You want me

690
00:30:47,322 --> 00:30:49,723
to sign a performance-based agreement,

691
00:30:50,003 --> 00:30:50,522
right?

692
00:30:50,643 --> 00:30:51,243
Mr. Qu.

693
00:30:51,483 --> 00:30:52,643
As the head

694
00:30:52,723 --> 00:30:53,762
of the group,

695
00:30:54,322 --> 00:30:55,003
you've planned

696
00:30:55,003 --> 00:30:56,443
to bid for the North Waichuan plot,

697
00:30:56,883 --> 00:30:57,683
and proposed

698
00:30:57,802 --> 00:30:58,683
if the bid succeeds,

699
00:30:58,683 --> 00:30:59,643
we'll terminate early

700
00:30:59,643 --> 00:31:01,203
your one-year probation period.

701
00:31:01,203 --> 00:31:01,762
Right?

702
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:05,403
This bid could transform

703
00:31:05,403 --> 00:31:07,082
the real estate landscape.

704
00:31:08,163 --> 00:31:10,362
The demands seem reasonable, right?

705
00:31:12,963 --> 00:31:14,042
But if you fail,

706
00:31:14,403 --> 00:31:16,322
Jinda's stock will plummet.

707
00:31:16,443 --> 00:31:17,883
You're newly appointed.

708
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:18,762
The shareholders

709
00:31:18,963 --> 00:31:20,362
have reservations.

710
00:31:20,602 --> 00:31:21,443
Hence, they proposed

711
00:31:21,443 --> 00:31:23,243
a performance-based agreement.

712
00:31:24,003 --> 00:31:24,643
If you succeed,

713
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:26,082
your probation will end early.

714
00:31:26,203 --> 00:31:27,042
If you fail,

715
00:31:27,362 --> 00:31:28,602
the Chairman position

716
00:31:28,683 --> 00:31:30,203
will be up for re-election.

717
00:31:31,163 --> 00:31:31,643
Mr. Qu.

718
00:31:32,483 --> 00:31:33,282
Don't get us wrong.

719
00:31:33,963 --> 00:31:35,362
This isn't personal.

720
00:31:35,963 --> 00:31:37,122
Every new chairman

721
00:31:37,122 --> 00:31:37,883
must undergo

722
00:31:38,203 --> 00:31:39,643
such challenges in their probation.

723
00:31:39,842 --> 00:31:40,362
After all,

724
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:42,082
the shareholders want to see

725
00:31:42,243 --> 00:31:43,522
solid financial performance.

726
00:31:44,122 --> 00:31:45,163
That applies to everyone.

727
00:31:51,522 --> 00:31:52,723
I'm back.

728
00:31:54,322 --> 00:31:55,203
How's Haochen doing?

729
00:31:55,723 --> 00:31:57,483
He's been doing great.

730
00:31:57,883 --> 00:31:59,082
I met Miss Sun

731
00:31:59,082 --> 00:31:59,883
and greeted her.

732
00:32:00,122 --> 00:32:00,802
If there's

733
00:32:00,802 --> 00:32:01,883
any problem with Haochen,

734
00:32:01,883 --> 00:32:03,082
she'll contact us.

735
00:32:05,602 --> 00:32:07,522
Anyway, don't worry.

736
00:32:08,443 --> 00:32:08,963
Everything

737
00:32:08,963 --> 00:32:10,243
is getting better.

738
00:32:12,082 --> 00:32:12,762
Haochen

739
00:32:12,762 --> 00:32:14,003
asked to go back to school.

740
00:32:14,082 --> 00:32:15,163
That's truly remarkable.

741
00:32:15,883 --> 00:32:16,723
My mom is also

742
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:18,203
grateful to you and Grandma.

743
00:32:19,723 --> 00:32:21,003
If she puts it that way,

744
00:32:21,362 --> 00:32:22,562
it feels too formal.

745
00:32:24,003 --> 00:32:24,842
Haochen gets better,

746
00:32:24,963 --> 00:32:26,243
and our family will be better.

747
00:32:28,802 --> 00:32:29,362
Alright.

748
00:32:33,403 --> 00:32:35,522
How's your physical store project?

749
00:32:36,082 --> 00:32:37,122
Everything is on track.

750
00:32:37,602 --> 00:32:39,443
The renovation
is more than halfway done.

751
00:32:39,842 --> 00:32:41,403
And Yao has completed

752
00:32:41,403 --> 00:32:42,842
the botanical dyeing series designs.

753
00:32:42,842 --> 00:32:44,082
I'll see them today.

754
00:32:44,683 --> 00:32:45,282
Great.

755
00:32:47,362 --> 00:32:48,762
What's your plan?

756
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:53,723
Bid for the North Waichuan plot.

757
00:32:54,602 --> 00:32:56,683
Qu Mingcheng made other shareholders

758
00:32:56,802 --> 00:32:58,003
sue me and my dad,

759
00:32:58,883 --> 00:33:01,522
demanding us
to compensate the group's losses.

760
00:33:02,082 --> 00:33:03,762
Our accounts are frozen,

761
00:33:04,362 --> 00:33:06,163
and we lost our positions at Jinda.

762
00:33:06,602 --> 00:33:07,762
Everyone thinks

763
00:33:07,842 --> 00:33:09,883
I couldn't win the bid

764
00:33:10,403 --> 00:33:11,522
for this Diamond Plot.

765
00:33:13,203 --> 00:33:14,963
I know I can't win forever,

766
00:33:15,762 --> 00:33:17,203
but for Dad and Haochen,

767
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:19,403
I won't lose to Qu Mingcheng.

768
00:33:24,923 --> 00:33:26,683
Which company will you use for the bid?

769
00:33:27,082 --> 00:33:28,203
My dad's first company,

770
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:29,683
called Xinye.

771
00:33:30,443 --> 00:33:32,163
Our core team members

772
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:33,483
have all resigned

773
00:33:34,282 --> 00:33:35,483
and will stick with me.

774
00:33:37,203 --> 00:33:39,082
I have the confidence and energy

775
00:33:39,282 --> 00:33:40,322
to continue bidding.

776
00:33:40,842 --> 00:33:42,842
And thank you for your help too.

777
00:33:46,602 --> 00:33:48,042
I don't accept verbal thanks.

778
00:33:49,203 --> 00:33:50,602
If you want to thank me,

779
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:53,362
do it properly

780
00:33:53,683 --> 00:33:54,562
when you succeed.

781
00:33:55,522 --> 00:33:56,042
Yes.

782
00:33:57,322 --> 00:33:57,883
By the way,

783
00:33:58,883 --> 00:34:00,203
you're meeting Mr. Huang, right?

784
00:34:00,403 --> 00:34:00,762
Yes.

785
00:34:01,643 --> 00:34:02,602
Your suit and tie

786
00:34:02,602 --> 00:34:03,723
are upstairs.

787
00:34:05,723 --> 00:34:06,322
See?

788
00:34:06,443 --> 00:34:08,522
Thank you very much for your support.

789
00:34:08,602 --> 00:34:09,403
I told you

790
00:34:09,403 --> 00:34:11,042
I don't accept verbal thanks.

791
00:34:14,202 --> 00:34:14,722
Haoming.

792
00:34:15,283 --> 00:34:17,202
Is everything going smoothly
in the new company?

793
00:34:17,763 --> 00:34:18,283
Pretty well.

794
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:19,883
I hope

795
00:34:20,122 --> 00:34:21,843
I can collaborate with you.

796
00:34:23,082 --> 00:34:24,082
To be honest,

797
00:34:24,443 --> 00:34:26,682
without capital

798
00:34:26,722 --> 00:34:27,763
or corporate backing,

799
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:29,883
how can I cooperate with you?

800
00:34:31,562 --> 00:34:32,602
Four years ago,

801
00:34:33,642 --> 00:34:34,682
when North Waichuan's

802
00:34:35,363 --> 00:34:36,883
development plans were announced,

803
00:34:38,122 --> 00:34:39,202
my team and I

804
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,003
started monitoring.

805
00:34:40,642 --> 00:34:41,483
About land supply,

806
00:34:41,883 --> 00:34:42,923
policy directions,

807
00:34:43,162 --> 00:34:44,363
municipal planning,

808
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:46,963
and our competitors' strategies,

809
00:34:47,363 --> 00:34:48,562
we've conducted the research.

810
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:50,162
I'll offer the proposal.

811
00:34:50,443 --> 00:34:51,443
You'll offer the capital.

812
00:34:52,483 --> 00:34:53,522
Let's bid jointly.

813
00:34:57,722 --> 00:34:58,722
For this project,

814
00:34:59,283 --> 00:35:01,642
I'm not pursuing profits,

815
00:35:03,443 --> 00:35:05,122
but to defeat Qu Mingcheng.

816
00:35:35,682 --> 00:35:36,162
Mr. Huang.

817
00:35:36,202 --> 00:35:36,883
Mr. Qu is here.

818
00:35:37,403 --> 00:35:37,963
Let him in.

819
00:35:38,363 --> 00:35:38,923
Mr. Qu.

820
00:35:39,562 --> 00:35:40,403
There's no denying

821
00:35:40,483 --> 00:35:42,363
your offer is very generous,

822
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:45,283
but I have reservations.

823
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:47,283
Shen Haoming is young.

824
00:35:47,323 --> 00:35:48,443
You can say

825
00:35:48,443 --> 00:35:50,242
he doesn't hold much sway
in the group yet.

826
00:35:50,763 --> 00:35:51,923
But Shen Jinsong

827
00:35:52,122 --> 00:35:54,283
is the founder of Jinda Group.

828
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,242
He's managed the group for decades.

829
00:35:56,562 --> 00:35:58,162
The shareholders

830
00:35:58,242 --> 00:36:00,122
may seem to be on your side now.

831
00:36:01,082 --> 00:36:02,682
But once Shen Jinsong recovers

832
00:36:02,682 --> 00:36:03,722
and returns to the group,

833
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:06,722
where will their loyalties lie?

834
00:36:08,843 --> 00:36:09,722
Shen Jinsong

835
00:36:09,763 --> 00:36:11,403
can't even take care of himself now.

836
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:12,602
He's completely

837
00:36:12,602 --> 00:36:13,722
out of this battlefield.

838
00:36:14,283 --> 00:36:15,122
Nothing to fear.

839
00:36:18,562 --> 00:36:19,923
Bring me the documents

840
00:36:19,923 --> 00:36:21,162
about the bank credit loans.

841
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:22,242
Here.

842
00:36:22,522 --> 00:36:23,042
Here.

843
00:36:24,202 --> 00:36:25,162
This endorsement...

844
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:25,883
Okay.

845
00:36:26,242 --> 00:36:27,323
Compile the data.

846
00:36:27,763 --> 00:36:29,162
No. 9.

847
00:36:29,264 --> 00:36:29,744
(Project Objectives and Significance)

848
00:36:30,602 --> 00:36:31,242
Note this down.

849
00:36:32,403 --> 00:36:33,323
Good news!

850
00:36:34,202 --> 00:36:34,763
Mr. Chen

851
00:36:34,843 --> 00:36:36,082
will invest in our project.

852
00:36:36,722 --> 00:36:37,162
Really?

853
00:36:37,763 --> 00:36:38,323
Fantastic!

854
00:36:44,003 --> 00:36:44,602
How's this?

855
00:36:45,042 --> 00:36:45,763
Can you keep up?

856
00:36:46,843 --> 00:36:47,483
Mr. Huang.

857
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:49,483
You run marathons every year,

858
00:36:50,042 --> 00:36:50,963
even full distances.

859
00:36:51,562 --> 00:36:52,642
I need more practice.

860
00:36:52,923 --> 00:36:53,602
Haoming,

861
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:54,722
I enjoy

862
00:36:54,722 --> 00:36:56,042
teaming up with young people.

863
00:36:56,283 --> 00:36:57,283
You're energetic

864
00:36:57,323 --> 00:36:58,003
and resilient.

865
00:36:59,082 --> 00:37:00,003
I run alone

866
00:37:00,003 --> 00:37:01,242
by this lake every day,

867
00:37:01,283 --> 00:37:03,042
with no one to share

868
00:37:03,242 --> 00:37:04,162
such beautiful scenery.

869
00:37:05,403 --> 00:37:05,923
By the way,

870
00:37:06,363 --> 00:37:07,443
the proposal is ready.

871
00:37:08,082 --> 00:37:09,242
We can submit it soon.

872
00:37:10,122 --> 00:37:10,722
Haoming.

873
00:37:11,602 --> 00:37:12,522
I know

874
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:14,122
your vision, energy,

875
00:37:14,242 --> 00:37:15,323
and strategic mindset.

876
00:37:17,122 --> 00:37:18,202
I'm getting old.

877
00:37:18,562 --> 00:37:19,403
I am not

878
00:37:19,602 --> 00:37:20,883
what I used to be.

879
00:37:21,242 --> 00:37:22,562
I've wanted to retire.

880
00:37:23,042 --> 00:37:24,883
Make some investments and enjoy life.

881
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:27,483
But working with you

882
00:37:28,562 --> 00:37:29,323
makes me feel

883
00:37:29,323 --> 00:37:30,602
rejuvenated.

884
00:37:30,963 --> 00:37:31,602
I think

885
00:37:31,763 --> 00:37:32,923
I could still work.

886
00:37:33,522 --> 00:37:34,042
Mr. Huang.

887
00:37:34,522 --> 00:37:35,722
Don't retire yet.

888
00:37:35,923 --> 00:37:38,522
Stay and let us learn from you.

889
00:37:39,403 --> 00:37:39,843
Let's go.

890
00:37:40,283 --> 00:37:40,763
Haoming.

891
00:37:43,283 --> 00:37:44,042
Sorry.

892
00:37:45,883 --> 00:37:46,883
But for the second half,

893
00:37:47,443 --> 00:37:48,443
I want to run alone.

894
00:38:27,042 --> 00:38:28,443
That cunning Huang Chuming.

895
00:38:28,883 --> 00:38:29,883
We made the proposal

896
00:38:29,883 --> 00:38:31,202
as a joint venture until now.

897
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,883
The funding section especially

898
00:38:33,403 --> 00:38:33,963
was crucial

899
00:38:33,963 --> 00:38:35,202
for winning the bid.

900
00:38:35,883 --> 00:38:36,562
But he

901
00:38:37,122 --> 00:38:38,323
pulls out his investment

902
00:38:38,323 --> 00:38:39,323
without warning.

903
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,202
Revise our bidding strategy now

904
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:43,082
is impossible.

905
00:38:44,803 --> 00:38:46,283
With Mr. Huang's investment,

906
00:38:46,682 --> 00:38:47,363
we would

907
00:38:47,363 --> 00:38:48,562
at least have a support

908
00:38:49,082 --> 00:38:50,192
and stand a chance

909
00:38:50,192 --> 00:38:51,088
against Qu Mingcheng.

910
00:38:51,403 --> 00:38:53,003
But he withdraws

911
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:53,843
his investment,

912
00:38:54,122 --> 00:38:56,082
we stand no chance now.

913
00:38:56,722 --> 00:38:57,443
In my opinion,

914
00:38:57,722 --> 00:38:59,003
better to cut losses early

915
00:38:59,202 --> 00:39:00,202
than crash and burn.

916
00:39:00,403 --> 00:39:01,082
I suggest

917
00:39:01,642 --> 00:39:02,963
we withdraw from this bid.

918
00:39:03,283 --> 00:39:04,483
Why gamble

919
00:39:04,682 --> 00:39:06,283
on such a risky bid?

920
00:39:08,363 --> 00:39:08,923
Mr. Shen.

921
00:39:09,162 --> 00:39:10,003
What do you think?

922
00:39:12,042 --> 00:39:12,923
Continue.

923
00:39:16,602 --> 00:39:17,162
We've been

924
00:39:17,202 --> 00:39:18,522
prepping for ages.

925
00:39:19,923 --> 00:39:21,522
I don't want to waste your hard work.

926
00:39:22,242 --> 00:39:24,843
Let's revise the proposal

927
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:26,003
and submit it.

928
00:39:26,403 --> 00:39:27,682
Do it with

929
00:39:27,722 --> 00:39:29,682
the minimum 1 percent deposit.

930
00:39:31,003 --> 00:39:31,763
Why?

931
00:39:32,562 --> 00:39:34,122
Even if we fail, so what?

932
00:39:34,803 --> 00:39:35,443
Consider this

933
00:39:35,443 --> 00:39:37,162
our debut in the industry.

934
00:39:37,722 --> 00:39:38,763
Winning doesn't matter.

935
00:39:39,323 --> 00:39:40,483
I don't want others

936
00:39:40,722 --> 00:39:42,082
to think losing one partner

937
00:39:42,162 --> 00:39:43,403
makes us stuck

938
00:39:44,042 --> 00:39:44,722
and even lose

939
00:39:44,722 --> 00:39:45,722
the courage

940
00:39:45,722 --> 00:39:46,363
to compete.

941
00:39:47,963 --> 00:39:48,682
Keep discussing

942
00:39:48,883 --> 00:39:49,682
the proposal.

943
00:39:53,202 --> 00:39:54,003
Check if our project

944
00:39:54,042 --> 00:39:54,642
has green space

945
00:39:54,763 --> 00:39:55,803
development plans.

946
00:40:04,082 --> 00:40:05,162
Still working?

947
00:40:08,003 --> 00:40:09,003
It's late now.

948
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:13,122
We might fail

949
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,443
this Diamond Plot bidding,

950
00:40:14,843 --> 00:40:16,483
but as a new company,

951
00:40:16,883 --> 00:40:18,403
having a viable project

952
00:40:19,122 --> 00:40:20,602
builds market reputation.

953
00:40:25,642 --> 00:40:26,682
Found any suitable one?

954
00:40:26,843 --> 00:40:27,323
Yes.

955
00:40:27,803 --> 00:40:28,443
Take a look

956
00:40:28,963 --> 00:40:29,522
at this.

957
00:40:36,464 --> 00:40:36,923
(Shikumen Renovation Project)

958
00:40:36,923 --> 00:40:37,883
Shikumen?

959
00:40:38,843 --> 00:40:39,443
It is

960
00:40:39,443 --> 00:40:40,562
a renovation project.

961
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,522
Pretty nice.

962
00:40:46,642 --> 00:40:47,722
The collaboration

963
00:40:47,722 --> 00:40:49,242
with Gubei Town

964
00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:50,283
makes me realize

965
00:40:50,283 --> 00:40:51,082
the governments'

966
00:40:51,443 --> 00:40:54,642
efforts on cultural preservation.

967
00:40:55,283 --> 00:40:56,202
It has reached

968
00:40:56,202 --> 00:40:57,443
new heights recently.

969
00:41:00,602 --> 00:41:01,803
So this direction is correct.

970
00:41:02,522 --> 00:41:03,202
Exactly.

971
00:41:07,003 --> 00:41:07,483
What?

972
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:11,042
Your hair.

973
00:41:13,562 --> 00:41:14,283
Wrap it up

974
00:41:14,522 --> 00:41:15,403
and get some rest.

975
00:41:15,602 --> 00:41:16,082
Okay.

976
00:41:19,082 --> 00:41:19,883
Need company?

977
00:41:20,923 --> 00:41:21,803
No need.

978
00:41:21,963 --> 00:41:22,883
I'll be up shortly.

979
00:41:23,283 --> 00:41:23,803
Alright.

980
00:42:01,162 --> 00:42:01,803
Any progress?

981
00:42:02,042 --> 00:42:03,562
Yes.

982
00:42:04,162 --> 00:42:04,923
Good then.

983
00:42:05,722 --> 00:42:06,323
Go to sleep.

984
00:42:15,042 --> 00:42:16,122
I heard Shen Haoming

985
00:42:16,122 --> 00:42:17,522
landed a government-backed

986
00:42:17,843 --> 00:42:18,722
renovation project.

987
00:42:19,722 --> 00:42:20,562
Exactly.

988
00:42:21,162 --> 00:42:22,363
The cooperation is confirmed.

989
00:42:23,722 --> 00:42:24,682
He is

990
00:42:25,162 --> 00:42:26,483
quite smart,

991
00:42:27,202 --> 00:42:28,242
taking some projects

992
00:42:28,522 --> 00:42:29,642
to sustain his startup.

993
00:42:32,323 --> 00:42:34,042
Where's Weiping?

994
00:42:36,283 --> 00:42:37,803
You set up a new firm for him.

995
00:42:38,162 --> 00:42:39,242
As a rookie entrepreneur,

996
00:42:39,443 --> 00:42:40,122
he's swamped.

997
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:46,003
Anything else?

998
00:42:48,323 --> 00:42:48,883
Mr. Qu.

999
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,042
I know

1000
00:42:50,042 --> 00:42:51,162
you promised Weiping

1001
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:53,963
to let Jinda's legal team

1002
00:42:54,682 --> 00:42:55,483
channel our projects

1003
00:42:55,483 --> 00:42:56,522
to his firm.

1004
00:42:58,042 --> 00:42:58,763
However,

1005
00:42:59,602 --> 00:43:00,602
I've reviewed

1006
00:43:00,602 --> 00:43:01,682
another firm's proposal

1007
00:43:03,923 --> 00:43:05,042
that outperforms

1008
00:43:05,122 --> 00:43:06,283
his firm

1009
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:06,883
in every way.

1010
00:43:09,803 --> 00:43:11,803
But I promised Weiping.

1011
00:43:11,883 --> 00:43:12,403
Mr. Qu.

1012
00:43:13,162 --> 00:43:14,443
Appointing me to the board

1013
00:43:14,642 --> 00:43:15,403
has displeased

1014
00:43:15,403 --> 00:43:16,562
those shareholders.

1015
00:43:17,602 --> 00:43:19,242
If we channel our projects

1016
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:21,122
to a new firm,

1017
00:43:22,042 --> 00:43:23,963
they might suspect

1018
00:43:24,443 --> 00:43:25,803
your relationship with Weiping.

1019
00:43:29,483 --> 00:43:30,682
How about this?

1020
00:43:31,042 --> 00:43:32,363
Let's have a transitional period.

1021
00:43:32,883 --> 00:43:33,682
Anyway,

1022
00:43:33,682 --> 00:43:34,522
we can channel

1023
00:43:35,082 --> 00:43:36,843
the projects to Weiping later.

1024
00:43:43,642 --> 00:43:45,122
Then explain this properly to him.

1025
00:43:45,883 --> 00:43:47,483
Avoid causing unnecessary trouble.

1026
00:43:48,283 --> 00:43:48,963
Rest assured.

(Han Weiping)

1028
00:44:09,443 --> 00:44:10,042
Hello.

1029
00:44:10,323 --> 00:44:11,562
Meet me at the downstairs café.

1030
00:44:12,162 --> 00:44:12,682
Now.

(Jinda Group)

1032
00:44:15,122 --> 00:44:16,843
It's not up to you.

1033
00:44:17,483 --> 00:44:18,042
My godfather

1034
00:44:18,042 --> 00:44:18,923
has promised me

1035
00:44:19,483 --> 00:44:21,042
to sign a long-term agreement

1036
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:22,642
with my firm.

1037
00:44:23,283 --> 00:44:24,003
You asked me here

1038
00:44:24,003 --> 00:44:25,122
just to discuss this?

1039
00:44:27,522 --> 00:44:28,403
Your godfather is busy

1040
00:44:28,403 --> 00:44:29,722
with the North Waichuan plot.

1041
00:44:30,323 --> 00:44:31,722
This is the top priority now.

1042
00:44:33,202 --> 00:44:34,642
Can't you distinguish priorities?

1043
00:44:35,843 --> 00:44:36,642
Steve.

1044
00:44:38,602 --> 00:44:39,923
You're behind this, right?

1045
00:44:42,003 --> 00:44:42,923
I strongly suspect

1046
00:44:42,923 --> 00:44:44,562
this agreement will still be mine.

1047
00:44:50,722 --> 00:44:51,283
Weiping.

1048
00:44:52,003 --> 00:44:52,602
I understand

1049
00:44:52,602 --> 00:44:53,602
how you feel right now.

1050
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:56,363
However,

1051
00:44:57,323 --> 00:44:58,283
you did engage in

1052
00:44:58,283 --> 00:44:59,323
shady activities

1053
00:45:00,003 --> 00:45:01,242
for your godfather.

1054
00:45:02,042 --> 00:45:02,963
But now,

1055
00:45:03,363 --> 00:45:04,722
it's a critical period.

1056
00:45:05,483 --> 00:45:07,042
Mr. Qu has to be cautious.

1057
00:45:07,763 --> 00:45:08,602
Please understand.

1058
00:45:12,003 --> 00:45:14,042
Trying to kick me out now?

1059
00:45:14,682 --> 00:45:16,003
To take down the Shen family,

1060
00:45:16,522 --> 00:45:18,443
do you know how much I sacrificed?

1061
00:45:18,642 --> 00:45:20,122
The incident with Haochen last time

1062
00:45:20,562 --> 00:45:21,883
got me detained by police,

1063
00:45:22,602 --> 00:45:24,122
and I even lost my lawyer's license.

1064
00:45:24,803 --> 00:45:25,963
I've lost everything.

1065
00:45:27,883 --> 00:45:28,722
I'm going upstairs

1066
00:45:28,722 --> 00:45:29,722
to ask my godfather.

1067
00:45:32,483 --> 00:45:34,283
Aren't you afraid

1068
00:45:34,602 --> 00:45:35,923
it will cost your other hand too?

1069
00:45:42,042 --> 00:45:42,883
Young man,

1070
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:45,923
don't be so impulsive.

1071
00:45:54,443 --> 00:45:54,963
Mr. Qu.

1072
00:45:55,682 --> 00:45:56,403
Want to see me?

1073
00:45:57,403 --> 00:45:57,763
Haoming.

1074
00:45:57,763 --> 00:45:58,602
Have a seat.

1075
00:45:59,403 --> 00:46:00,082
Have a seat.

1076
00:46:07,923 --> 00:46:08,642
Haoming.

1077
00:46:09,963 --> 00:46:10,803
Actually,

1078
00:46:12,003 --> 00:46:13,562
this adversarial situation between us

1079
00:46:14,642 --> 00:46:15,883
isn't what I want.

1080
00:46:17,682 --> 00:46:18,642
I don't have children.

1081
00:46:19,602 --> 00:46:20,323
Since childhood,

1082
00:46:20,722 --> 00:46:21,883
you've been close to me.

1083
00:46:23,843 --> 00:46:24,682
To be honest,

1084
00:46:25,363 --> 00:46:26,242
sometimes

1085
00:46:26,443 --> 00:46:27,843
I genuinely envy your dad

1086
00:46:27,843 --> 00:46:29,082
for having a son like you.

1087
00:46:30,323 --> 00:46:31,443
My resentment

1088
00:46:31,763 --> 00:46:34,162
is solely toward your dad.

1089
00:46:36,042 --> 00:46:36,883
Think about it.

1090
00:46:37,122 --> 00:46:38,242
If he had shown

1091
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:40,682
more consideration to an old comrade

1092
00:46:40,763 --> 00:46:41,923
like me,

1093
00:46:42,843 --> 00:46:44,403
then the ones

1094
00:46:44,483 --> 00:46:45,283
to celebrate success

1095
00:46:45,283 --> 00:46:46,242
would be us.

1096
00:46:48,602 --> 00:46:49,682
You asked me to come

1097
00:46:50,522 --> 00:46:52,003
not for sentimental talk, right?

1098
00:46:54,843 --> 00:46:56,162
Your dad's hospitalization

1099
00:46:56,722 --> 00:46:58,283
isn't what I want.

1100
00:46:58,763 --> 00:47:00,003
Now you've

1101
00:47:00,082 --> 00:47:01,483
started a small company

1102
00:47:02,283 --> 00:47:03,283
and are taking on

1103
00:47:03,283 --> 00:47:04,283
government projects.

1104
00:47:04,323 --> 00:47:05,483
Taking the safe route

1105
00:47:06,562 --> 00:47:07,763
seems wise.

1106
00:47:10,283 --> 00:47:11,162
If...

1107
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:12,642
I mean, if.

1108
00:47:13,323 --> 00:47:15,003
If you want to,

1109
00:47:16,562 --> 00:47:17,682
I can

1110
00:47:18,122 --> 00:47:20,122
buy your shares

1111
00:47:20,602 --> 00:47:21,843
from you and your dad

1112
00:47:21,883 --> 00:47:22,963
at a favorable price.

1113
00:47:23,803 --> 00:47:25,162
As for the compensation lawsuit,

1114
00:47:25,763 --> 00:47:27,003
we can withdraw it.

1115
00:47:27,522 --> 00:47:29,803
This is the best for you.

1119
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:40,162
any shares.

This is

my best offer

1122

to you two.

1123
00:47:52,602 --> 00:47:53,963
If you reject,

1124
00:47:55,483 --> 00:47:56,682
you and your dad will have

1125
00:47:56,722 --> 00:47:58,003
to go against the entire group.

1126
00:47:58,562 --> 00:48:01,363

00:50:30,642 --> 00:50:31,803
bidding strategy

1169
00:50:32,042 --> 00:50:34,242
and bidding collusion scheme.

1170
00:50:35,483 --> 00:50:37,602
I personally accuse

1171
00:50:38,323 --> 00:50:41,003
Jinda Group Chairman Qu Mingcheng

1172
00:50:42,162 --> 00:50:43,843
of orchestrating this

1173
00:50:44,363 --> 00:50:46,883
bidding collusion operation.

1174
00:51:02,122 --> 00:51:03,003
When arriving,

1175
00:51:03,283 --> 00:51:04,722
did you see that car downstairs?

1176
00:51:05,042 --> 00:51:05,642
I saw it.

1177
00:51:07,562 --> 00:51:09,003
My every move now

1178
00:51:10,082 --> 00:51:11,522
is being monitored by Qu Mingcheng.

1179
00:51:12,522 --> 00:51:14,363
He's afraid you'll make a move.

1180
00:51:15,003 --> 00:51:16,363
But he never expected

1181
00:51:17,443 --> 00:51:19,003
you would side with me.

1182
00:51:20,363 --> 00:51:20,923
Alright.

1183
00:51:21,522 --> 00:51:22,363
You can go now.

1184
00:51:22,602 --> 00:51:23,682
He'll come up shortly.

00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:34,443

1192
00:52:02,266 --> 00:52:05,843
(North Waichuan Plot 1137
Bidding Conference)

1193
00:52:05,843 --> 00:52:06,923
Due to accidental reasons,

1194
00:52:07,803 --> 00:52:09,923

1195
00:52:11,122 --> 00:52:12,722
