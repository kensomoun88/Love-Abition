Actually,

29
00:01:56,177 --> 00:01:57,097
our last vacation

30
00:01:57,858 --> 00:01:58,858
was our honeymoon.

31
00:02:08,057 --> 00:02:09,538
I need to tell you something.

32
00:02:10,138 --> 00:02:11,698
Jiang Liang invested in Yan Studio.

33
00:02:12,057 --> 00:02:12,538
He...

34
00:02:12,578 --> 00:02:13,337
Jiang Liang?

35
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,177
What does he know?

36
00:02:16,858 --> 00:02:18,138
He relies on his sister.

37
00:02:19,298 --> 00:02:20,657
He doesn't do anything.

38
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:21,418
He's no good.

39
00:02:22,258 --> 00:02:23,937
He gave me some advice

40
00:02:24,657 --> 00:02:25,978
that was quite practical.

41
00:02:26,378 --> 00:02:27,777
He's not so clueless.

42
00:02:28,337 --> 00:02:29,098
When did he

43
00:02:29,418 --> 00:02:30,418
give you advice?

44
00:02:31,337 --> 00:02:32,057
A month ago.

45
00:02:32,457 --> 00:02:33,497
I ran into him

46
00:02:33,497 --> 00:02:34,177
at the cafe.

47
00:02:34,617 --> 00:02:35,497
A month ago?

48
00:02:36,138 --> 00:02:36,897
Why didn't you

49
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:38,177
tell me you needed funds?

50
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:40,457
Back then...

51
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:45,457
Why would I tell you?

52
00:02:50,018 --> 00:02:50,617
Who am I

53
00:02:51,617 --> 00:02:52,418
to you?

54
00:02:55,897 --> 00:02:56,418
Yeah.

55
00:02:57,818 --> 00:02:58,937
I shouldn't interfere.

56
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:01,177
I should thank you.

57
00:03:02,578 --> 00:03:03,538
You secured funding

58
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:05,337
from an investor.

59
00:03:06,057 --> 00:03:07,418
That's why you're helping

60
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:09,418
your soon-to-be ex-husband

61
00:03:10,217 --> 00:03:11,457
for some pocket money.

62
00:03:12,457 --> 00:03:13,897
How noble of you.

63
00:03:15,258 --> 00:03:16,057
Do you have to

64
00:03:16,057 --> 00:03:17,418
be so sarcastic?

65
00:03:22,698 --> 00:03:23,937
I don't want to argue.

66
00:03:24,258 --> 00:03:25,217
Let's be serious.

67
00:03:25,818 --> 00:03:27,057
Before I agreed

68
00:03:27,057 --> 00:03:28,177
to help you,

69
00:03:29,978 --> 00:03:30,858
I had been

70
00:03:30,858 --> 00:03:31,818
at my wits' end.

71
00:03:32,418 --> 00:03:32,978
Jiang Liang

72
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:33,858
introduced me

73
00:03:34,538 --> 00:03:35,777
to a photographer.

74
00:03:35,978 --> 00:03:36,538
But he didn't

75
00:03:36,538 --> 00:03:37,578
promise to invest.

76
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,737
My sister called me just now,
saying that

77
00:03:39,858 --> 00:03:40,457
Jiang Liang saw

78
00:03:40,457 --> 00:03:41,217
the latest video

79
00:03:41,217 --> 00:03:42,217
and decided to invest.

80
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:44,018
I told you immediately.

81
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:45,818
Isn't that prompt enough?

82
00:03:52,897 --> 00:03:53,617
True.

83
00:03:56,018 --> 00:03:58,298
I lied about having investors

84
00:03:58,858 --> 00:03:59,698
the other night.

85
00:04:08,978 --> 00:04:09,858
Ms. Xu.

86
00:04:10,057 --> 00:04:11,818
You're such an impressive actress.

87
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,538
Who knows what other lies

88
00:04:13,538 --> 00:04:14,258
you've told?

89
00:04:24,578 --> 00:04:25,217
I've told

90
00:04:25,217 --> 00:04:26,097
a million lies.

91
00:04:28,378 --> 00:04:28,938
I had a fever

92
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:30,618
when I interviewed you

93
00:04:30,857 --> 00:04:31,738
at Jinda Group.

94
00:04:31,857 --> 00:04:32,417
It was real.

95
00:04:32,938 --> 00:04:33,777
But I didn't faint.

96
00:04:39,097 --> 00:04:39,698
Mr. Shen.

97
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:40,618
Sorry to have

98
00:04:40,777 --> 00:04:41,498
kept you waiting.

99
00:04:42,217 --> 00:04:43,258
Let's talk

100
00:04:43,337 --> 00:04:44,018
over lunch.

101
00:04:57,178 --> 00:04:58,977
The band-aid I gave you at the hospital

102
00:05:00,457 --> 00:05:01,897
was bought by Secretary Chen.

103
00:05:03,297 --> 00:05:05,337
I saw how moved you were,

104
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:06,657
so I stayed silent.

105
00:05:11,258 --> 00:05:12,138
Also,

106
00:05:12,698 --> 00:05:14,097
when you applied for the job,

107
00:05:14,457 --> 00:05:15,217
I read your post

108
00:05:15,217 --> 00:05:16,857
during the interview. Remember?

109
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:18,457
You wrote,

110
00:05:19,457 --> 00:05:21,018
"If Grandma has ever

111
00:05:21,018 --> 00:05:22,618
made osmanthus jam for you,

112
00:05:23,738 --> 00:05:26,537
you'll never feel lonely."

113
00:05:28,297 --> 00:05:29,578
Total nonsense.

114
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:31,537
Melodramatic rambling.

115
00:05:43,417 --> 00:05:44,537
Didn't I tell you

116
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:46,178
I learned ballet in school?

117
00:05:46,657 --> 00:05:47,657
I learned street dance.

118
00:05:47,977 --> 00:05:48,698
Popping.

119
00:05:48,897 --> 00:05:49,657
Breaking.

120
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,178
Come on!

121
00:05:51,178 --> 00:05:52,258
Listen to me.

122
00:05:52,938 --> 00:05:54,217
Every outfit you chose for me

123
00:05:54,217 --> 00:05:55,777
disappointed me.

124
00:05:55,977 --> 00:05:57,378
The colors, quality,

125
00:05:57,537 --> 00:05:58,217
and taste

126
00:05:58,297 --> 00:05:59,297
were all terrible.

127
00:05:59,618 --> 00:06:01,138
Reflect on yourself.

128
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:02,217
Look inward.

129
00:06:02,217 --> 00:06:03,138
Is it because

130
00:06:03,138 --> 00:06:04,657
you're outdated and stuffy

131
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:06,058
with taste behind the times?

132
00:06:07,297 --> 00:06:08,258
Your slicked-back hair

133
00:06:08,457 --> 00:06:09,258
never changes.

134
00:06:10,058 --> 00:06:10,777
And your suit

135
00:06:11,457 --> 00:06:12,457
is always the same.

136
00:06:12,818 --> 00:06:13,337
What's wrong?

137
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:14,417
Are you bed linens?

138
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:15,337
And those glasses.

139
00:06:15,378 --> 00:06:16,178
Are you nearsighted?

140
00:06:16,297 --> 00:06:17,417
Why do you wear them?

141
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:17,977
What for?

142
00:06:18,018 --> 00:06:19,138
To act like old money?

143
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:26,178
I'm better than you.

144
00:06:27,018 --> 00:06:29,657
You claim to be a food expert

145
00:06:30,058 --> 00:06:31,297
and host Family Feast.

146
00:06:32,097 --> 00:06:33,537
None of the food

147
00:06:34,657 --> 00:06:36,738
you cook tastes good.

148
00:06:36,777 --> 00:06:37,738
It's awful.

149
00:06:37,818 --> 00:06:39,457
I force myself to eat it, okay?

150
00:06:39,537 --> 00:06:40,738
The jewelry pieces you gave me

151
00:06:41,698 --> 00:06:42,938
are tacky and tasteless.

152
00:06:43,698 --> 00:06:44,977
Not a single one I like.

153
00:06:46,288 --> 00:06:47,472
Forced myself to accept them.

154
00:06:49,018 --> 00:06:49,578
Fine.

155
00:06:50,178 --> 00:06:51,018
I'll tell

156
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:52,698
Secretary Chen.

157
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:54,698
I didn't buy them, anyway.

158
00:06:55,337 --> 00:06:56,657
I didn't even check them.

159
00:07:01,258 --> 00:07:02,138
Doesn't matter.

160
00:07:02,897 --> 00:07:04,337
It doesn't matter.

161
00:07:04,777 --> 00:07:05,818
Men's gifts are

162
00:07:05,818 --> 00:07:06,618
all the same.

163
00:07:06,738 --> 00:07:07,698
I'm used to it.

164
00:07:08,578 --> 00:07:09,258
Used to it?

165
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:11,417
How many guys

166
00:07:11,897 --> 00:07:12,618
have you dated?

167
00:07:12,618 --> 00:07:13,616
How many did I tell you?

168
00:07:14,618 --> 00:07:15,777
You said I was the only one.

169
00:07:15,857 --> 00:07:16,297
Yeah.

170
00:07:16,618 --> 00:07:17,378
Just one.

171
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:18,698
Plus a zero.

172
00:07:35,457 --> 00:07:36,496
Three days later, the 8th,

173
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:38,378
meet me at the Bureau at 10 AM.

174
00:07:50,777 --> 00:07:52,857
Yuanhang is a major investment firm.

175
00:07:53,217 --> 00:07:54,457
We're just a start-up.

176
00:07:54,818 --> 00:07:56,618
Why would Jiang Liang invest in us?

177
00:07:56,698 --> 00:07:58,297
Investing in successful start-ups

178
00:07:58,297 --> 00:07:59,378
is just bandwagoning.

179
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:00,618
Investing now shows

180
00:08:01,217 --> 00:08:02,178
vision.

181
00:08:02,337 --> 00:08:04,138
- Vision.
- Vision.

182
00:08:05,498 --> 00:08:05,938
Alright.

183
00:08:06,297 --> 00:08:07,618
We have an investor.

184
00:08:07,698 --> 00:08:08,977
Our video got 10k likes.

185
00:08:09,018 --> 00:08:09,698
We're doing well.

186
00:08:10,058 --> 00:08:11,698
Let's hope everything picks up.

187
00:08:11,777 --> 00:08:12,457
Fingers crossed.

188
00:08:12,857 --> 00:08:13,857
Only good news ahead.

189
00:08:14,258 --> 00:08:14,897
So

190
00:08:15,337 --> 00:08:16,657
let's drink till we drop.

191
00:08:17,977 --> 00:08:18,698
Till we drop.

192
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:19,657
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

193
00:08:19,897 --> 00:08:21,258
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

194
00:08:37,378 --> 00:08:38,657
I heard your Chinese grades

195
00:08:38,657 --> 00:08:39,577
dropped recently.

196
00:08:40,098 --> 00:08:41,697
Do you need a tutor?

197
00:08:42,738 --> 00:08:44,697
No tutor beats sis-in-law.

198
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,458
She's so patient

199
00:08:47,697 --> 00:08:49,577
and explains things clearly.

200
00:08:50,577 --> 00:08:52,297
I get it right away.

201
00:08:55,138 --> 00:08:55,618
Haoming,

202
00:08:55,697 --> 00:08:57,057
when are you bringing her back?

203
00:08:58,738 --> 00:08:59,937
She's still busy with work

204
00:09:00,697 --> 00:09:01,738
and won't return soon.

205
00:09:03,537 --> 00:09:05,458
You clearly miss her.

206
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:06,697
Just beg for forgiveness.

207
00:09:06,697 --> 00:09:08,218
I don't miss her.

208
00:09:10,498 --> 00:09:11,897
Say one thing and mean another.

209
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:13,738
That's the idiom for you.

210
00:09:15,258 --> 00:09:17,138
She's definitely still angry.

211
00:09:17,618 --> 00:09:18,577
Did you apologize

212
00:09:18,577 --> 00:09:19,817
sincerely to her?

213
00:09:21,777 --> 00:09:23,378
Seems you've mastered Chinese.

214
00:09:24,138 --> 00:09:25,738
Idioms flow naturally now.

215
00:09:27,937 --> 00:09:29,057
Wait a minute.

216
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:30,657
Sit.

217
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,417
Sit down.

218
00:09:39,218 --> 00:09:39,978
First,

219
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:41,657
sis-in-law taught me that idiom.

220
00:09:42,057 --> 00:09:43,777
Second, you should know this.

221
00:09:44,378 --> 00:09:45,738
When guys get rejected,

222
00:09:45,738 --> 00:09:47,057
it's okay.

223
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,057
Even if you're rejected 100 times,

224
00:09:49,098 --> 00:09:50,378
you must win her back

225
00:09:50,378 --> 00:09:50,978
in the end.

226
00:09:51,338 --> 00:09:51,978
Got it?

227
00:09:54,777 --> 00:09:55,618
If only

228
00:09:55,618 --> 00:09:56,657
you could study with

229
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:57,577
such perseverance.

230
00:09:58,417 --> 00:09:59,697
Mind your own business.

231
00:09:59,937 --> 00:10:00,378
Okay?

232
00:10:00,577 --> 00:10:01,218
Okay.

233
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:02,738
My performance is

234
00:10:02,738 --> 00:10:03,978
none of your business, either.

235
00:10:13,218 --> 00:10:14,618
Close the door on your way out.

236
00:10:26,138 --> 00:10:27,657
(When guys get rejected,)

237
00:10:27,657 --> 00:10:28,657
(it's okay.)

238
00:10:29,057 --> 00:10:30,738
Even if you're rejected 100 times,

239
00:10:31,218 --> 00:10:32,897
you must win her back

240
00:10:32,897 --> 00:10:33,458
in the end.

241
00:10:46,338 --> 00:10:47,537
What's up?

242
00:10:49,177 --> 00:10:50,297
Are you there?

243
00:10:53,297 --> 00:10:54,057
(Shen Haoming)
Going to bed?

244
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:01,657
(Xu Yan)

245
00:11:01,657 --> 00:11:02,218
(Not yet.)

246
00:11:02,577 --> 00:11:03,138
(What's up?)

247
00:11:06,138 --> 00:11:07,858
(Shen Haoming)
(Mr. Baraikin and I)

248
00:11:07,858 --> 00:11:09,258
(spoke on the phone.)

249
00:11:09,537 --> 00:11:12,018
(He'll visit Jinda in a few days.)

250
00:11:15,577 --> 00:11:16,858
(If you're free,)

251
00:11:17,057 --> 00:11:18,657
(let's have dinner together.)

252
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:21,138
(I can't.)

253
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:22,378
(I've been swamped.)

254
00:11:22,657 --> 00:11:23,537
(Give him my regards.)

255
00:11:27,657 --> 00:11:28,177
(Shen Haoming)
(Alright.)

256
00:11:29,258 --> 00:11:30,577
(I'll have Chen)

257
00:11:30,618 --> 00:11:32,018
(wire you the money.)

258
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:37,458
(Xu Yan)
(Thanks.)

259
00:11:41,537 --> 00:11:42,537
How do I win her back?

260
00:11:43,098 --> 00:11:44,378
Should I keep arguing with her?

261
00:11:44,657 --> 00:11:45,858
I'm such an idiot.

262
00:11:58,657 --> 00:11:59,098
Again.

263
00:11:59,498 --> 00:12:01,218
You're the sparring partner applicant?

264
00:12:05,897 --> 00:12:06,897
With your physique,

265
00:12:06,978 --> 00:12:07,858
can you handle it?

266
00:12:08,297 --> 00:12:09,057
No problem.

267
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:10,657
In our line of work,

268
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:12,498
we must endure hits.

269
00:12:13,138 --> 00:12:13,897
Not everyone

270
00:12:13,897 --> 00:12:14,817
can withstand this.

271
00:12:15,537 --> 00:12:16,018
Sir.

272
00:12:16,338 --> 00:12:18,098
I want to learn how to take hits.

273
00:12:18,618 --> 00:12:19,098
Fine.

274
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,618
Let's give it a try.

275
00:12:21,297 --> 00:12:22,738
When do we start?

276
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:25,937
Right now.

277
00:12:26,297 --> 00:12:27,138
Headshot first.

278
00:12:27,817 --> 00:12:28,618
Pardon?

279
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,048
(Treatise on Superfluous Things)

280
00:12:32,048 --> 00:12:33,178
While...

281
00:12:40,138 --> 00:12:40,738
Grandma, look.

282
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:41,657
See?

283
00:12:41,697 --> 00:12:43,218
Nice office, right?

284
00:12:43,777 --> 00:12:44,858
Let me show you around.

285
00:12:45,018 --> 00:12:45,498
See?

286
00:12:46,297 --> 00:12:47,018
This is

287
00:12:47,177 --> 00:12:48,817
our main lobby.

288
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,018
- The second floor.
- So spacious.

289
00:12:51,057 --> 00:12:52,297
Display wall.

290
00:12:52,378 --> 00:12:53,098
See?

291
00:12:53,417 --> 00:12:54,258
And we have...

292
00:12:54,537 --> 00:12:55,297
Look who this is.

293
00:12:55,297 --> 00:12:56,218
Grandma.

294
00:12:56,618 --> 00:12:57,098
Look.

295
00:12:57,218 --> 00:12:58,096
You like our office?

296
00:12:59,618 --> 00:13:01,098
Yan, Lin,

297
00:13:01,577 --> 00:13:02,378
you girls really

298
00:13:02,498 --> 00:13:04,138
picked a great place.

299
00:13:04,297 --> 00:13:05,858
Spacious and bright.

300
00:13:06,098 --> 00:13:06,978
I'm here.

301
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:08,018
Is it Grandma?

302
00:13:09,297 --> 00:13:09,897
Hi, Grandma.

303
00:13:09,978 --> 00:13:10,458
Grandma.

304
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,378
This is our designer

305
00:13:12,537 --> 00:13:14,138
I keep telling you about.

306
00:13:14,138 --> 00:13:14,897
Yao.

307
00:13:15,057 --> 00:13:16,897
Here's our long-legged model,

308
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:17,657
Guan.

309
00:13:17,657 --> 00:13:18,177
Look.

310
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:19,577
- Hi Grandma.
- See her legs?

311
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,738
Yan, Lin,

312
00:13:23,057 --> 00:13:25,177
and your partners,

313
00:13:26,218 --> 00:13:28,098
Yao, Guan, right?

314
00:13:28,338 --> 00:13:28,858
You girls

315
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:29,897
are very talented

316
00:13:29,897 --> 00:13:31,417
young ladies.

317
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,338
I'm so happy

318
00:13:34,378 --> 00:13:35,858
to see you working together.

319
00:13:36,657 --> 00:13:38,618
I wish you a grand opening

320
00:13:39,216 --> 00:13:40,098
and booming business.

321
00:13:40,138 --> 00:13:42,098
- Thanks, Grandma.
- Thanks, Grandma.

322
00:13:42,098 --> 00:13:43,458
Grandma's the best.

323
00:13:43,978 --> 00:13:44,498
Alright then.

324
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:46,018
I won't keep you any longer.

325
00:13:46,177 --> 00:13:47,057
You're busy girls.

326
00:13:47,777 --> 00:13:48,297
Okay.

327
00:13:48,338 --> 00:13:49,018
Bye, Grandma.

328
00:13:49,057 --> 00:13:49,937
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

329
00:13:49,978 --> 00:13:50,537
I have to go.

330
00:13:51,138 --> 00:13:51,897
Go ahead.

331
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:53,098
Bye, Grandma.

332
00:13:53,498 --> 00:13:54,057
Miss you.

333
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:58,258
Why are you hanging up?

334
00:13:58,258 --> 00:13:59,177
Talk to me more.

335
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,738
I just want to tell you.

336
00:14:03,937 --> 00:14:04,577
Life is not

337
00:14:05,338 --> 00:14:07,177
all about making money.

338
00:14:08,378 --> 00:14:10,697
You need inherent confidence.

339
00:14:11,177 --> 00:14:12,738
I hope you can

340
00:14:12,858 --> 00:14:14,417
maintain good spirits

341
00:14:15,018 --> 00:14:18,378

00:14:18,937 --> 00:14:19,738
Okay, Grandma.

00:14:21,258 --> 00:14:22,177
Remember that...

345
00:14:22,338 --> 00:14:22,858
Yan.

346
00:14:22,858 --> 00:14:23,897
Take your medicine.

347

Yeah.

355
00:14:34,018 --> 00:14:36,138
More than enough.

356
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:37,937
Alright.

Let's go big.

362

00:15:21,057 --> 00:15:21,777
Careful.

392
00:15:37,258 --> 00:15:37,978
Mr. Shen.

393
00:15:38,657 --> 00:15:39,577
The design has been

394
00:15:39,618 --> 00:15:40,177
revised.

395
00:15:40,697 --> 00:15:42,338
The design team wants to meet.

396
00:15:42,897 --> 00:15:44,138
I checked your schedule.

397
00:15:44,498 --> 00:15:44,978
You're

398
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:45,978
only available on the 8th

399
00:15:47,817 --> 00:15:48,458
this month.

400
00:15:50,697 --> 00:15:52,458
The Legal Department added three clauses

401
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:54,018
to the contract annex

402
00:15:54,018 --> 00:15:54,897
as requested.

403
00:15:55,498 --> 00:15:56,018
Also,

404
00:15:56,138 --> 00:15:57,978
they modified clauses

405
00:15:57,978 --> 00:15:58,777
No. 3 and No. 8.

406
00:15:59,297 --> 00:15:59,897
I've booked

407
00:16:00,297 --> 00:16:01,738
private room No. 8 in Yipinxuan

408
00:16:02,057 --> 00:16:02,738
for tonight.

409
00:16:07,098 --> 00:16:07,897
Mr. Shen.

410
00:16:08,777 --> 00:16:09,777
Is something wrong?

411
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:12,138
From now on,

412
00:16:13,258 --> 00:16:15,098
I don't want to hear the number "eight".

413
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:28,897
Mr. Shen.

414
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:30,417
Land acquisition evaluation

415
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:31,338
and market research

416
00:16:31,378 --> 00:16:32,417
on Project 018

417
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:33,258
have been completed.

418
00:16:33,537 --> 00:16:34,978
Most land acquisitions

419
00:16:34,978 --> 00:16:35,978
are feasible.

420
00:16:36,378 --> 00:16:38,378
Except that

421
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:39,297
a 120-mu plot

422
00:16:39,297 --> 00:16:40,577
in the core zone

423
00:16:40,817 --> 00:16:42,258
has been purchased.

424
00:16:42,897 --> 00:16:44,338
It was acquired

425
00:16:44,577 --> 00:16:45,498
ten years ago.

426
00:16:47,537 --> 00:16:48,338
Ten years ago?

427
00:16:48,738 --> 00:16:50,338
It was a remote wasteland back then

428
00:16:50,978 --> 00:16:51,978
without any

429
00:16:52,258 --> 00:16:53,057
development plans.

430
00:16:54,618 --> 00:16:55,738
Who'd buy land there?

431
00:16:56,138 --> 00:16:57,897
Mr. Shen Haoming.

432
00:17:02,177 --> 00:17:02,577
Dad.

433
00:17:03,498 --> 00:17:04,337
You want to see me?

434
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,018
You bought the 120-mu land

435
00:17:07,097 --> 00:17:08,337
of Project 018 a decade ago?

436
00:17:08,738 --> 00:17:09,418
Why?

437
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,218
The government

438
00:17:14,018 --> 00:17:15,938
wanted to establish
a new free trade zone.

439
00:17:16,857 --> 00:17:17,577
The group

440
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:19,337
conducted evaluations

441
00:17:19,898 --> 00:17:21,617
and prioritized development

442
00:17:21,658 --> 00:17:23,978
in the eastern and southern areas.

443
00:17:24,658 --> 00:17:25,178
First,

444
00:17:25,938 --> 00:17:27,218
they wanted to be close

445
00:17:27,777 --> 00:17:28,458
to downtown.

446
00:17:29,218 --> 00:17:29,817
Second,

447
00:17:30,337 --> 00:17:32,218
the eastern and southern peripherals

448
00:17:32,337 --> 00:17:34,537
had a relatively complete infrastructure

449
00:17:34,658 --> 00:17:35,458
for residential use.

450
00:17:35,817 --> 00:17:37,178
Everyone thought

451
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:39,978
the northern area was barren land

452
00:17:40,418 --> 00:17:41,857
with no development value.

453
00:17:42,178 --> 00:17:42,698
Indeed.

454
00:17:42,817 --> 00:17:44,498
That's what the executives thought.

455
00:17:46,258 --> 00:17:46,857
But

456
00:17:47,577 --> 00:17:48,097
people

457
00:17:48,097 --> 00:17:49,698
overlooked one critical factor.

458
00:17:51,577 --> 00:17:52,297
High-speed rail.

459
00:17:55,297 --> 00:17:56,617
The rail network plan

460
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:58,418
announced that year

461
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:00,938
showed that the high-speed rail

462
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,617
would connect major economic zones

463
00:18:04,297 --> 00:18:05,738
and reduce intercity distances.

464
00:18:06,698 --> 00:18:08,418
I studied the published blueprint.

465
00:18:09,258 --> 00:18:10,738
The rail extended to the north,

466
00:18:11,577 --> 00:18:13,377
intersecting with our free trade zone's

467
00:18:13,898 --> 00:18:15,337
intercity light rail system.

468
00:18:16,337 --> 00:18:18,498
A city's subway planning

469
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:20,097
must coordinate with

470
00:18:20,137 --> 00:18:21,337
major transportation hubs.

471
00:18:22,178 --> 00:18:22,898
So, I predicted

472
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:25,137
that the municipal government would

473
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,617
leverage the transportation hub

474
00:18:27,057 --> 00:18:29,258
and establish a New District.

475
00:18:30,097 --> 00:18:31,258
So, I believed this land

476
00:18:31,337 --> 00:18:32,418
was worth investing in.

477
00:18:33,377 --> 00:18:34,258
That means

478
00:18:35,218 --> 00:18:37,018
you demonstrated remarkable foresight

479
00:18:37,297 --> 00:18:38,258
back then.

480
00:18:39,698 --> 00:18:40,978
I must thank you

481
00:18:41,018 --> 00:18:42,377
for sending me to the top schools

482
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,537
where I learned

483
00:18:44,698 --> 00:18:46,137
diverse urban designs

484
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:46,978
and planning.

485
00:18:48,218 --> 00:18:49,178
But I have a question.

486
00:18:50,537 --> 00:18:51,498
You wanted to

487
00:18:51,537 --> 00:18:52,617
acquire the project.

488
00:18:53,057 --> 00:18:53,938
You'd need money.

489
00:18:54,178 --> 00:18:55,577
Where did your funding come from?

490
00:18:57,057 --> 00:18:58,577
From my college classmates.

491
00:19:00,137 --> 00:19:01,297
They had

492
00:19:01,698 --> 00:19:02,777
considerable idle funds

493
00:19:03,337 --> 00:19:04,617
but lacked knowledge

494
00:19:04,738 --> 00:19:06,658
of profitable investment channels.

495
00:19:07,698 --> 00:19:08,857
I managed

496
00:19:09,097 --> 00:19:10,337
some short-term futures

497
00:19:10,498 --> 00:19:11,817
through the years,

498
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,297
earning them good returns

499
00:19:13,617 --> 00:19:15,297
as well as their trust.

500
00:19:15,857 --> 00:19:16,537
I see.

501
00:19:18,577 --> 00:19:19,658
One more question.

502
00:19:21,137 --> 00:19:21,857
Since you've been

503
00:19:22,018 --> 00:19:24,218
operating this project for so long.

504
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:25,698
What would you ask for

505
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,418
to hand it over

506
00:19:27,537 --> 00:19:28,458
to our company?

507
00:19:28,577 --> 00:19:29,137
Feel free

508
00:19:29,337 --> 00:19:30,297
to make any requests.

509
00:19:30,577 --> 00:19:31,097
Alright?

510
00:19:34,738 --> 00:19:36,018
I'll transfer this land

511
00:19:36,978 --> 00:19:37,777
to the group

512
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,258
to meet all corporate needs

513
00:19:40,738 --> 00:19:42,137
without any conditions.

514
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:46,938
Why?

515
00:19:49,537 --> 00:19:49,978
Dad.

516
00:19:51,938 --> 00:19:53,817
I've been thinking about

517
00:19:55,577 --> 00:19:57,018
what happened with Haochen.

518
00:19:58,337 --> 00:19:59,498
It seems I've never

519
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:00,537
properly apologized

520
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:01,537
to you or Mom

521
00:20:02,097 --> 00:20:03,178
about this.

522
00:20:09,137 --> 00:20:10,418
Regarding this matter,

523
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,178
your mom and I

524
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,218
don't need apologies.

525
00:20:15,377 --> 00:20:16,777
We just want you to understand

526
00:20:18,097 --> 00:20:19,057
that everyone

527
00:20:19,057 --> 00:20:19,898
must take

528
00:20:20,297 --> 00:20:21,938
full responsibility for their actions.

529
00:20:23,577 --> 00:20:24,178
I understand.

530
00:20:25,938 --> 00:20:27,258
That's also my philosophy.

531
00:20:29,137 --> 00:20:30,018
But I've always

532
00:20:30,218 --> 00:20:31,297
hoped that you could

533
00:20:31,377 --> 00:20:32,297
understand me.

534
00:20:33,258 --> 00:20:35,258
But I never considered your feelings.

535
00:20:36,097 --> 00:20:37,898
I don't regret
what happened with Haochen.

536
00:20:39,418 --> 00:20:40,498
But I know it has

537
00:20:40,537 --> 00:20:41,777
caused you and Mom

538
00:20:41,777 --> 00:20:42,698
tremendous stress.

539
00:20:43,738 --> 00:20:44,817
This is my fault.

540
00:20:46,218 --> 00:20:47,938
I had a bad temper before.

541
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:49,617
I acted tough

542
00:20:51,258 --> 00:20:52,857
because I was insecure

543
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,097
and anxious.

544
00:20:54,738 --> 00:20:56,698
I didn't know what would happen.

545
00:20:59,978 --> 00:21:01,617
Eventually, I saw that you and Mom

546
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:04,057
accepted Haochen,

547
00:21:05,777 --> 00:21:07,178
giving him a carefree

548
00:21:07,577 --> 00:21:08,617
living environment.

549
00:21:10,297 --> 00:21:11,617
Your tolerance

550
00:21:11,898 --> 00:21:13,537
truly empowered me.

551
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,698
We've quarreled

552
00:21:21,938 --> 00:21:22,777
and fought

553
00:21:24,137 --> 00:21:24,898
quite enough.

554
00:21:27,777 --> 00:21:29,097
After I calmed down,

555
00:21:31,777 --> 00:21:32,777
I did realize

556
00:21:32,817 --> 00:21:33,857
why you doubted me

557
00:21:34,258 --> 00:21:35,057
both then

558
00:21:36,418 --> 00:21:37,817
and right now.

559
00:21:39,938 --> 00:21:40,817
I must

560
00:21:41,817 --> 00:21:43,057
take the responsibility.

561
00:21:45,577 --> 00:21:46,418
That's why

562
00:21:46,577 --> 00:21:47,537
I never intended

563
00:21:47,617 --> 00:21:48,857
to negotiate terms with you.

564
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:53,018
You came back

565
00:21:54,577 --> 00:21:55,537
from the resort

566
00:21:55,577 --> 00:21:56,777
as a different person.

567
00:21:59,817 --> 00:22:01,218
(If you love someone,)

568
00:22:02,377 --> 00:22:03,498
you should trust them

569
00:22:04,218 --> 00:22:05,337
and believe their actions

570
00:22:05,337 --> 00:22:06,377
are meant to protect you.

571
00:22:07,018 --> 00:22:08,698
No matter how old we grow,

572
00:22:10,218 --> 00:22:11,337
in our elders' eyes,

573
00:22:11,537 --> 00:22:12,938
we'll always remain children.

574
00:22:13,777 --> 00:22:15,857
But their distrust doesn't equate

575
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:18,377
to indifference or neglect.

576
00:22:21,658 --> 00:22:23,297
I'll send the land transfer agreement

577
00:22:23,738 --> 00:22:24,617
to the group.

578
00:22:28,018 --> 00:22:29,057
Listen, Haoming.

579
00:22:29,698 --> 00:22:30,698
If you can

580
00:22:30,938 --> 00:22:32,018
facilitate

581
00:22:32,137 --> 00:22:33,817
official collaboration with Baraikin

582
00:22:33,938 --> 00:22:34,938
and expand

583
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:36,097
our overseas market,

584
00:22:36,377 --> 00:22:37,698
then I promise that

585
00:22:38,577 --> 00:22:40,178
I'll bring you onto the board.

586
00:22:41,658 --> 00:22:42,817
But remember this.

587
00:22:44,018 --> 00:22:45,337
Once you're in this game,

588
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:47,297
you'll face doubts

589
00:22:47,377 --> 00:22:48,258
and even scrutiny

590
00:22:48,418 --> 00:22:49,297
from more people.

591
00:22:49,738 --> 00:22:50,617
Besides, I won't

592
00:22:50,978 --> 00:22:52,978
allow you to make any mistakes.

593
00:22:54,898 --> 00:22:55,377
Dad.

594
00:22:56,537 --> 00:22:57,297
I don't mind that.

595
00:22:58,297 --> 00:22:59,898
I just hope you can

596
00:23:00,617 --> 00:23:01,537
start trusting me.

597
00:23:02,658 --> 00:23:03,418
I also hope

598
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:05,817
I can start trusting you.

599
00:23:07,617 --> 00:23:08,297
Come on, son.

600
00:23:08,817 --> 00:23:09,817
Walk with me.

601
00:23:17,018 --> 00:23:18,608
(Yan Studio)

602
00:23:24,898 --> 00:23:25,297
Sit.

603
00:23:25,898 --> 00:23:26,377
Hello.

604
00:23:26,458 --> 00:23:27,817
My name is Meng Zhao.

605
00:23:27,898 --> 00:23:29,738
I graduated from
Jingzhou Business University.

606
00:23:30,137 --> 00:23:31,097
I'm Zhao Kehuan

607
00:23:31,097 --> 00:23:32,738
from Jingzhou Communication University,

608
00:23:32,738 --> 00:23:33,898
majoring in Broadcasting.

609
00:23:34,018 --> 00:23:34,898
I'm Qu Xiaowan,

610
00:23:35,057 --> 00:23:36,178
24 years old.

611
00:23:36,337 --> 00:23:38,057
I worked at a 4A agency.

612
00:23:38,137 --> 00:23:39,258
I was a planner

613
00:23:39,258 --> 00:23:40,337
of Family Feast.

614
00:23:40,817 --> 00:23:42,178
What are you applying for?

615
00:23:42,498 --> 00:23:43,898
Promotion Specialist.

616
00:23:44,057 --> 00:23:44,912
Business Specialist.

617
00:23:45,018 --> 00:23:45,777
Anything will do.

618
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:47,458
I'll do whatever you assign me.

619
00:23:47,617 --> 00:23:48,137
Rest assured.

620
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,498
I'm highly action-oriented.

621
00:23:49,617 --> 00:23:50,377
I will complete

622
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:51,498
any tasks given to me.

623
00:23:51,698 --> 00:23:52,498
She's like you.

624
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:53,938
I'm not so direct.

625
00:23:54,817 --> 00:23:55,978
What's your expected salary?

626
00:23:56,178 --> 00:23:58,137
Depends on the workload.

627
00:23:58,498 --> 00:23:59,577
At my previous company,

628
00:23:59,698 --> 00:24:01,218
my salary was higher because

629
00:24:01,377 --> 00:24:02,337
I did a triple workload.

630
00:24:02,577 --> 00:24:03,857
I'll accept a normal salary

631
00:24:04,137 --> 00:24:05,018
for a normal workload.

632
00:24:05,178 --> 00:24:05,857
Don't worry.

633
00:24:06,458 --> 00:24:08,057
We'll hire more business specialists

634
00:24:08,337 --> 00:24:09,057
if needed.

635
00:24:09,498 --> 00:24:10,258
It would be great

636
00:24:10,337 --> 00:24:12,857
if the salary could be
a bit higher than my previous job.

637
00:24:13,258 --> 00:24:14,297
Otherwise, I can accept

638
00:24:14,297 --> 00:24:15,178
the same salary.

639
00:24:15,337 --> 00:24:16,218
I'm still young.

640
00:24:16,337 --> 00:24:18,218
Money isn't that important to me.

641
00:24:18,377 --> 00:24:19,418
Opportunity matters more.

642
00:24:20,137 --> 00:24:20,698
Thank you.

643
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:21,898
Thank you.

644
00:24:23,386 --> 00:24:26,418
(Yan Studio)

645
00:24:26,418 --> 00:24:27,658
Welcome to Yan Studio.

646
00:24:29,057 --> 00:24:30,097
Thanks for joining us.

647
00:24:30,418 --> 00:24:30,938
Yan.

648
00:24:31,097 --> 00:24:32,178
I'll go wherever you are.

649
00:24:32,617 --> 00:24:33,218
I promise

650
00:24:33,258 --> 00:24:34,097
I'll work hard.

651
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,336
(Yan Studio)

652
00:24:46,297 --> 00:24:47,337
Mr. Jiang Liang.

653
00:24:47,537 --> 00:24:48,617
Welcome to Yan Studio.

654
00:24:49,178 --> 00:24:49,658
Do you like

655
00:24:49,817 --> 00:24:50,777
the environment here?

656
00:24:51,097 --> 00:24:51,738
It's amazing.

657
00:24:53,218 --> 00:24:53,857
Your first video

658
00:24:53,857 --> 00:24:54,777
has done so well.

659
00:24:54,857 --> 00:24:56,218
When will you post the second one?

660
00:24:57,137 --> 00:24:58,018
(Yan Studio)
Let's get in.

661
00:24:58,218 --> 00:24:59,018
The staff are ready

662
00:24:59,018 --> 00:24:59,738
to brief you.

663
00:24:59,938 --> 00:25:00,817
- Alright.
- This way.

664
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,776
(Civil Affairs Bureau, 8th)

665
00:26:13,498 --> 00:26:15,056
(Shen Haoming)

666
00:26:26,738 --> 00:26:27,137
Hello.

667
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:28,817
Hello.

668
00:26:29,698 --> 00:26:30,258
What's wrong?

669
00:26:31,738 --> 00:26:33,178
Nothing. Just a reminder.

670
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,337
Tomorrow's the 8th.

671
00:26:38,137 --> 00:26:39,297
See you at the Bureau

672
00:26:39,377 --> 00:26:40,018
at 10 AM.

673
00:26:41,137 --> 00:26:41,938
Bad timing.

674
00:26:42,498 --> 00:26:44,137
I'm on a business trip in Russia.

675
00:26:45,297 --> 00:26:46,537
You went to Russia?

676
00:26:47,617 --> 00:26:48,297
You know,

677
00:26:48,337 --> 00:26:50,097
things are going well with Mr. Baraikin.

678
00:26:50,617 --> 00:26:51,458
So I have to strike

679
00:26:51,898 --> 00:26:53,258
when the iron's hot.

680
00:26:56,577 --> 00:26:58,018
But didn't we agree to meet

681
00:26:59,178 --> 00:27:00,537
at the Bureau on the 8th?

682
00:27:02,418 --> 00:27:03,498
Next month, maybe.

683
00:27:04,218 --> 00:27:06,018
Then the application will expire.

684
00:27:08,178 --> 00:27:08,817
What can I do?

685
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:10,018
I'm busy.

686
00:27:11,777 --> 00:27:13,218
I'm traveling to France,

687
00:27:13,297 --> 00:27:13,938
England,

688
00:27:14,057 --> 00:27:14,978
and so on.

689
00:27:15,738 --> 00:27:16,577
I can't go back.

690
00:27:17,898 --> 00:27:18,777
Shen Haoming.

691
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:19,617
Do you have to

692
00:27:19,617 --> 00:27:20,738
go on a business trip now?

693
00:27:21,377 --> 00:27:23,377
Mr. Baraikin approached me.

694
00:27:23,698 --> 00:27:24,777
I can't tell him,

695
00:27:24,817 --> 00:27:26,018
"Let me get divorced first",

696
00:27:26,097 --> 00:27:26,537
can I?

697
00:27:27,018 --> 00:27:27,817
Come here.

698
00:27:28,218 --> 00:27:29,178
Mr. Baraikin needs me.

699
00:27:29,258 --> 00:27:29,898
I have to go.

700
00:27:29,938 --> 00:27:30,537
Coming.

701
00:27:30,777 --> 00:27:31,577
Okay, bye.

702
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:54,018
Xin, stop running.

703
00:27:54,258 --> 00:27:55,137
You can't go in.

704
00:27:55,297 --> 00:27:56,218
You can't go in there.

705
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:56,658
Be good.

706
00:28:03,258 --> 00:28:05,218
It's not a good angle.

707
00:28:11,178 --> 00:28:12,458
She'll believe it, right?

708
00:28:14,898 --> 00:28:15,817
I need more photos.

709
00:28:23,098 --> 00:28:25,712
(Yan)

710
00:28:47,377 --> 00:28:48,458
Next stop: Africa.

711
00:28:53,617 --> 00:28:54,658
Alexandria.

712
00:29:10,938 --> 00:29:11,498
Chen Lin.

713
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:14,218
Photoshop these trees out.

714
00:29:15,738 --> 00:29:17,906
(A few days later)

715
00:29:31,698 --> 00:29:32,738
Hello? Yan.

716
00:29:34,218 --> 00:29:35,418
Is Shen Haoming in Jingzhou?

717
00:29:37,178 --> 00:29:38,297
Mr. Shen is in Moscow.

718
00:29:42,738 --> 00:29:44,178
Got it. Thanks.

719
00:29:46,682 --> 00:29:49,200
(July 8th)

720
00:29:51,137 --> 00:29:51,658
Chen Lin.

721
00:29:51,898 --> 00:29:52,617
Did Xu Yan

722
00:29:52,817 --> 00:29:53,738
call you today?

723
00:29:53,898 --> 00:29:55,097
Just as you predicted.

724
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:56,537
She called several times.

725
00:29:56,738 --> 00:29:57,218
Good.

726
00:29:57,938 --> 00:29:58,258
Okay.

727
00:29:58,377 --> 00:29:59,738
I won't be at the office.

728
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,258
Call me if anything comes up.

729
00:30:24,418 --> 00:30:25,377
It's an illusion.

730
00:30:26,698 --> 00:30:27,498
It must be.

731
00:30:38,898 --> 00:30:39,498
Illusion.

732
00:30:51,297 --> 00:30:52,577
Aren't you in Russia?

733
00:30:54,698 --> 00:30:56,777
Which city is Shen Haoming in now?

734
00:30:57,938 --> 00:30:59,137
He's in Moscow.

735
00:31:00,377 --> 00:31:01,577
But he told me

736
00:31:01,577 --> 00:31:02,817
he's in Alexandria.

737
00:31:04,577 --> 00:31:05,698
Yeah, he's in Alexandria.

738
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:06,978
My mistake, Yan.

739
00:31:07,377 --> 00:31:08,978
Mr. Shen is in Alexandria.

740
00:31:12,097 --> 00:31:13,938
But you just said he was in Russia.

741
00:31:15,178 --> 00:31:15,738
Yeah.

742
00:31:15,817 --> 00:31:17,218
Alexandria in Russia.

743
00:31:17,938 --> 00:31:19,658
Alexandria is in Egypt.

744
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:22,032
(Paid Promotion)

745
00:31:25,698 --> 00:31:27,458
Doesn't Russia have a city
named Alexandria?

746
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:32,738
I changed my schedule last minute.

747
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:36,178
Thanks for cooperating.

748
00:31:38,537 --> 00:31:39,297
The Bureau, now.

749
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,218
I changed my plans

750
00:31:41,218 --> 00:31:42,337
due to health issues.

751
00:31:42,337 --> 00:31:43,418
I'm seeing a doctor.

752
00:31:43,537 --> 00:31:44,137
What's wrong?

753
00:31:50,738 --> 00:31:51,418
Heart problems.

754
00:31:52,698 --> 00:31:53,392
Chest tightness.

755
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:54,577
Heartache.

756
00:31:54,898 --> 00:31:55,537
Palpitations.

757
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:57,018
Discomfort.

758
00:31:57,297 --> 00:31:58,537
I can't breathe.

759
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:01,898
Alright.

760
00:32:02,258 --> 00:32:03,137
I'll go with you.

761
00:32:04,698 --> 00:32:05,097
Hurry up.

762
00:32:09,418 --> 00:32:10,178
Mr. Shen,

763
00:32:11,577 --> 00:32:12,938
your heart is perfectly fine.

764
00:32:13,137 --> 00:32:14,178
No issues whatsoever.

765
00:32:15,137 --> 00:32:15,698
Really?

766
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:18,498
Then why do I feel chest tightness

767
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:19,617
and palpitations?

768
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,698
That's from the guilt.

769
00:32:23,218 --> 00:32:24,658
The possible causes

770
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:25,658
could be numerous,

771
00:32:26,018 --> 00:32:26,577
but

772
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:27,777
it's definitely not

773
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:30,137
caused by cardiac issues.

774
00:32:31,218 --> 00:32:32,658
It's more related

775
00:32:32,898 --> 00:32:33,658
to work stress

776
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:35,617
and emotional fluctuations.

777
00:32:37,857 --> 00:32:38,577
Have you

778
00:32:38,658 --> 00:32:40,258
been anxious

779
00:32:40,698 --> 00:32:42,337
about anything lately?

780
00:32:43,178 --> 00:32:43,777
Doctor,

781
00:32:44,577 --> 00:32:46,097
I don't think he's anxious

782
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:46,898
about anything.

783
00:32:46,938 --> 00:32:48,018
But he's been

784
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:49,698
tired and exhausted

785
00:32:49,872 --> 00:32:51,888
since he's been flying to
many countries every day.

786
00:32:52,418 --> 00:32:53,498
I mean, walking to...

787
00:32:53,537 --> 00:32:54,018
Right?

788
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:56,097
Walking to many countries every day.

789
00:32:56,498 --> 00:32:57,057
So tiring.

790
00:32:58,978 --> 00:32:59,698
Mr. Shen,

791
00:33:00,218 --> 00:33:02,018
you must rest
despite your heavy schedule.

792
00:33:02,337 --> 00:33:03,617
I'll prescribe some nourishing

793
00:33:03,658 --> 00:33:04,537
and calming

794
00:33:04,698 --> 00:33:05,458
medications.

795
00:33:05,537 --> 00:33:06,057
Listen.

796
00:33:06,377 --> 00:33:07,537
Since we can't

797
00:33:07,577 --> 00:33:08,498
find the cause here,

798
00:33:08,817 --> 00:33:10,337
maybe I should get

799
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:12,218
a comprehensive checkup.

800
00:33:14,057 --> 00:33:15,218
That's a good idea.

801
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:17,658
We can rule out

802
00:33:17,658 --> 00:33:18,498
other possibilities.

803
00:33:18,817 --> 00:33:19,898
You and your wife

804
00:33:20,418 --> 00:33:21,537
will be more reassured.

805
00:33:21,898 --> 00:33:22,258
Okay.

806
00:33:23,137 --> 00:33:23,617
I will

807
00:33:23,817 --> 00:33:25,498
schedule you for an MRI first.

808
00:33:26,097 --> 00:33:26,617
No,

809
00:33:27,018 --> 00:33:28,057
I think I need

810
00:33:28,658 --> 00:33:30,097
comprehensive tests,

811
00:33:30,777 --> 00:33:32,617
beginning with ENT

812
00:33:33,698 --> 00:33:34,898
and ophthalmology.

813
00:33:35,938 --> 00:33:36,458
Alright.

814
00:33:48,097 --> 00:33:48,817

Stop rushing me.

830
00:35:18,217 --> 00:35:18,858
Almost done.

These matters

836
00:35:28,778 --> 00:35:30,137
can't be rushed.

837
00:35:30,818 --> 00:35:32,097
I'm waiting for the urge.

00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:34,177
waiting for the urge

840
00:35:34,177 --> 00:35:35,097
for over half an hour.

We'll be late.

844
00:35:40,978 --> 00:35:41,737
Now I feel it.

845
00:35:42,818 --> 00:35:43,537
Now?

846
00:35:43,778 --> 00:35:44,257

Sorry.

Uh.

Hurry.

855

We're really sorry.

860
00:36:05,177 --> 00:36:06,818
Can you make an exception

861
00:36:06,978 --> 00:36:07,898
and do it for us?

862

Yes.

It's been thirty days.

00:36:16,378 --> 00:36:17,458

866
00:36:17,577 --> 00:36:18,338
divorced?

Yes.

Okay.

Come back on the 8th

872

next month before 5:30 PM.

873
00:36:32,737 --> 00:36:33,177
Wait.

875
00:36:36,217 --> 00:36:37,617

Whenever I need some time alone,

902
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:14,378
this is where I come.

It's open for me 24/7.

904

No disturbances.

905
00:38:21,537 --> 00:38:22,217
I can tell

906
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,458
you love films.

907
00:38:29,418 --> 00:38:30,338
When I was young,

908
00:38:31,057 --> 00:38:32,137
my dad was busy working.

909
00:38:33,338 --> 00:38:34,418
My sister studied abroad.

910
00:38:36,537 --> 00:38:37,697
Only my mom was there

911
00:38:38,657 --> 00:38:39,697
during my childhood.

912
00:38:42,378 --> 00:38:43,378
She loved movies.

913
00:38:44,097 --> 00:38:45,338
She took me to a movie

914
00:38:45,338 --> 00:38:46,177
almost every day.

915
00:38:47,898 --> 00:38:49,577
Those two magical hours

916
00:38:51,617 --> 00:38:52,338
were her gift

917
00:38:52,338 --> 00:38:53,257
of happiness.

918
00:38:57,778 --> 00:38:59,137
I wanted to study filming

919
00:39:03,378 --> 00:39:04,257
in college.

920
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:06,498
But I had to

921
00:39:06,657 --> 00:39:07,697
study finance as my dad

922
00:39:07,697 --> 00:39:08,298
requested.

923
00:39:11,577 --> 00:39:12,418
Then

924
00:39:14,697 --> 00:39:15,537
my parents passed.

925
00:39:16,617 --> 00:39:17,657
My sister was busy.

926
00:39:20,217 --> 00:39:21,338
I went to the movies alone.

927
00:39:27,257 --> 00:39:28,458
So this is a collection

928
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:29,617
of your regrets.

929
00:39:35,057 --> 00:39:35,938
As a director,

930
00:39:36,498 --> 00:39:37,938
I missed my leading lady.

931
00:39:39,298 --> 00:39:40,217
But as a businessman,

932
00:39:41,737 --> 00:39:42,418
I found you.

933
00:39:43,858 --> 00:39:45,498
My one-in-a-lifetime

934
00:39:47,577 --> 00:39:48,137
partner.

935
00:39:48,978 --> 00:39:50,338
I didn't have the privilege

936
00:39:50,737 --> 00:39:52,458
to watch movies as a kid.

937
00:39:54,298 --> 00:39:55,737
But I loved TV shows

938
00:39:57,257 --> 00:39:58,657
and news anchors.

939
00:40:00,137 --> 00:40:01,298
So I wondered

940
00:40:02,778 --> 00:40:03,858
whether I could

941
00:40:05,338 --> 00:40:06,458
become like them.

942
00:40:08,177 --> 00:40:08,697
See,

943
00:40:09,458 --> 00:40:10,217
we have a lot

944
00:40:10,257 --> 00:40:11,018
in common.

945
00:40:11,978 --> 00:40:12,498
Right?

946
00:40:18,737 --> 00:40:19,858
This...

947
00:40:21,057 --> 00:40:22,057
looks like...

948
00:40:22,298 --> 00:40:24,057
The same as the one in Roman Holiday.

949
00:40:24,298 --> 00:40:24,978
Exactly.

950
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,418
I've watched that movie.

951
00:40:32,217 --> 00:40:33,057
Can I take a photo?

952
00:40:33,537 --> 00:40:34,097
Let me do it.

953
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:35,097
Thanks, I got this.

954
00:40:58,778 --> 00:41:00,097
I don't like the ending.

955
00:41:01,498 --> 00:41:02,617
One day to love.

956
00:41:03,137 --> 00:41:04,298
A lifetime to forget.

957
00:41:05,018 --> 00:41:05,498
How tragic.

958
00:41:06,057 --> 00:41:07,018
What a tragedy.

959
00:41:09,177 --> 00:41:10,938
All the kids would think

960
00:41:10,938 --> 00:41:12,057
that a princess

961
00:41:12,418 --> 00:41:13,978
should break through all obstacles

962
00:41:14,057 --> 00:41:15,537
and be with her true love.

963
00:41:16,737 --> 00:41:17,257
Only adults

964
00:41:17,257 --> 00:41:18,537
realize that people

965
00:41:19,617 --> 00:41:21,018
from different backgrounds

966
00:41:21,137 --> 00:41:22,657
have different responsibilities

967
00:41:22,818 --> 00:41:23,537
and problems.

968
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:25,537
A loving couple

969
00:41:25,537 --> 00:41:26,858
may not end up together.

970
00:41:28,378 --> 00:41:29,378
Roman Holiday

971
00:41:31,338 --> 00:41:32,458
wasn't really a fairy tale.

972
00:41:34,378 --> 00:41:35,217
I remember

973
00:41:35,257 --> 00:41:36,137
there was a line.

974
00:41:39,577 --> 00:41:40,816
"Lift up your head, princess.

975
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:42,577
If not, the crown falls."

976
00:41:44,217 --> 00:41:45,378
I share this line with you.

977
00:41:46,697 --> 00:41:47,298
But I prefer

978
00:41:47,298 --> 00:41:48,498
another line.

979
00:41:50,617 --> 00:41:51,818
"Life isn't always

980
00:41:51,818 --> 00:41:53,057
what one likes."

981
00:42:19,217 --> 00:42:19,737
Hey, pretty.

982
00:42:20,697 --> 00:42:21,537
Want to be the first

983
00:42:21,537 --> 00:42:22,458
to ride shotgun?

984
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:23,978
Hop on.

985
00:42:25,697 --> 00:42:26,378
Mr. Liang.

986
00:42:31,697 --> 00:42:33,057
Meiru. What a coincidence.

987
00:42:34,257 --> 00:42:35,338
She is...?

988
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:37,537
Hello.

989
00:42:39,137 --> 00:42:39,978
I'm Xu Yan,

990
00:42:40,657 --> 00:42:41,840
Mr. Liang's business partner.

991
00:42:43,577 --> 00:42:44,298
This is...

992
00:42:44,338 --> 00:42:45,097
I'm Meiru.

993
00:42:45,498 --> 00:42:46,577
I work in self-media.

994
00:42:51,617 --> 00:42:52,217
Mr. Liang,

995
00:42:52,657 --> 00:42:54,137
you tricked me into hopping on,

996
00:42:54,177 --> 00:42:54,737
but this bike

997
00:42:54,737 --> 00:42:55,778
couldn't even start.

998
00:42:56,298 --> 00:42:57,537
Why are you riding it again?

999
00:43:02,858 --> 00:43:04,057
I guess I'm not

1000
00:43:04,057 --> 00:43:05,018
your first passenger.

1001
00:43:09,057 --> 00:43:09,938
Give me a second.

1002
00:43:12,378 --> 00:43:13,137
Come here.

1003
00:43:13,217 --> 00:43:13,617
Come on.

1004
00:43:13,818 --> 00:43:14,537
Come on.

1005
00:43:16,577 --> 00:43:17,257
Why are you here?

1006
00:43:17,737 --> 00:43:18,418
You lectured me

1007
00:43:18,458 --> 00:43:19,577
on film history.

1008
00:43:19,778 --> 00:43:20,938
It was really enlightening.

1009
00:43:21,338 --> 00:43:22,458
So I'm planning

1010
00:43:22,458 --> 00:43:23,537
a movie salon event.

1011
00:43:23,898 --> 00:43:24,938
Will you tell me more?

1012
00:43:27,018 --> 00:43:28,097
Did you sign up for

1013
00:43:28,097 --> 00:43:29,217
that art program

1014
00:43:29,338 --> 00:43:29,978
I suggested?

1015
00:43:32,018 --> 00:43:32,498
You didn't.

1016
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:34,657
That program

1017
00:43:34,697 --> 00:43:36,137
will do you good.

1018
00:43:36,657 --> 00:43:37,657
Complete the course,

1019
00:43:37,778 --> 00:43:39,097
and we'll discuss art.

1020
00:43:39,257 --> 00:43:39,737
Alright?

1021
00:43:42,298 --> 00:43:43,498
Remember to call me then.

1022
00:43:45,057 --> 00:43:45,537
Go ahead.

1023
00:43:49,898 --> 00:43:50,617
There you are.

1024
00:43:53,858 --> 00:43:54,737
Don't get me wrong.

1025
00:43:54,737 --> 00:43:55,697
She was just

1026
00:43:55,697 --> 00:43:56,617
an art enthusiast.

1027
00:43:57,097 --> 00:43:58,177
I get it, Mr. Liang.

1028
00:43:59,177 --> 00:44:00,617
You're just helping girls

1029
00:44:00,657 --> 00:44:01,978
improve themselves

1030
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:03,217
as their mentor.

1031
00:44:03,697 --> 00:44:04,418
Right?

1032
00:44:05,737 --> 00:44:06,938
I genuinely want to

1033
00:44:07,217 --> 00:44:08,657
show care and support

1034
00:44:09,057 --> 00:44:10,537
to the girls I meet.

1035
00:44:12,498 --> 00:44:13,418
Well done.

1036
00:44:14,177 --> 00:44:15,298
I have many other

1037
00:44:15,338 --> 00:44:16,057
good qualities.

1038
00:44:16,057 --> 00:44:17,298
You should get to know me.

1039
00:44:17,418 --> 00:44:18,338
Like our outfits.

1040
00:44:18,617 --> 00:44:20,257
Don't you see our outfits
match perfectly?

1041
00:44:20,657 --> 00:44:22,137
Aren't we in sync?

1042
00:44:28,602 --> 00:44:30,800
(Xu Yan)

1043
00:44:50,498 --> 00:44:51,338
Haoming.

1044
00:44:52,298 --> 00:44:52,938
What a surprise.

1045
00:44:58,778 --> 00:44:59,818
You know what?

1046
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:01,697
Rumors have been

1047
00:45:02,137 --> 00:45:03,657
spreading in our circle.

1048
00:45:05,097 --> 00:45:05,978
Xu Yan

1049
00:45:06,418 --> 00:45:07,378
and Jiang Liang

1050
00:45:07,898 --> 00:45:09,177
are really hitting it off.

1051
00:45:11,858 --> 00:45:12,498
You're drunk.

1052
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,818
Don't you know Jiang Liang?

1053
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,858
He's a ladies' man

1054
00:45:25,338 --> 00:45:26,818
who never commits to anyone.

1055
00:45:27,617 --> 00:45:29,137
Even he fell for Xu Yan

1056
00:45:29,137 --> 00:45:30,577
and got completely infatuated.

1057
00:45:32,057 --> 00:45:33,938
Xu Yan is quite something.

1058
00:45:37,898 --> 00:45:39,097
Or perhaps

1059
00:45:40,498 --> 00:45:42,298
she's desperate to find her next target.

1060
00:45:45,298 --> 00:45:46,537
Xu Yan is my wife.

1061
00:45:47,257 --> 00:45:48,097
Watch your mouth.

1062
00:45:49,338 --> 00:45:50,378
Still defending her.

1063
00:45:51,338 --> 00:45:52,298
She's just using you

1064
00:45:52,298 --> 00:45:53,137
as a rich fool.

1065
00:45:53,137 --> 00:45:54,137
And you still defend her.

1066
00:45:54,898 --> 00:45:55,537
Shen Haoming.

1067
00:45:55,737 --> 00:45:57,018
You should really check

1068
00:45:57,137 --> 00:45:57,737
whether she's

1069
00:45:57,737 --> 00:45:58,657
cheated on you.

1070
00:45:58,898 --> 00:45:59,617
Or maybe

1071
00:45:59,617 --> 00:46:00,537
you're used to it.

1072
00:46:06,057 --> 00:46:07,617
I'm the only one loyal to you.

1073
00:46:10,018 --> 00:46:11,057
But you won't even

1074
00:46:11,097 --> 00:46:12,018
look my way, will you?

1075
00:46:18,978 --> 00:46:20,057
You're such a coward.

1076
00:46:31,378 --> 00:46:32,577
You're finally looking at me.

1077
00:46:33,778 --> 00:46:34,617
Hit me then.

1078
00:46:34,778 --> 00:46:35,697
Why don't you hit me?

1079
00:46:35,737 --> 00:46:36,418
