28
00:01:45,178 --> 00:01:45,698
Thank you.

29
00:01:48,098 --> 00:01:49,978
This is considered
a celebration banquet today.

30
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:50,978
Of course.

31
00:01:51,937 --> 00:01:52,497
Lin Tao,

32
00:01:53,618 --> 00:01:55,538
do you know how I felt
when the bank notified me

33
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:56,777
that the loan was disbursed

34
00:01:56,777 --> 00:01:57,937
into the company's account?

35
00:01:59,338 --> 00:02:00,458
I was overjoyed.

36
00:02:00,657 --> 00:02:01,898
That was special privilege.

37
00:02:01,937 --> 00:02:03,657
How did I get such an amazing friend?

38
00:02:04,217 --> 00:02:05,898
A thousand words come down to this.

39
00:02:06,538 --> 00:02:07,497
Thank you.

40
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:09,298
Thank you for doing me such a big favor

41
00:02:09,537 --> 00:02:10,497
and helping Yan Studio.

42
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,738
This is actually

43
00:02:19,578 --> 00:02:20,738
the first time we're dining

44
00:02:20,738 --> 00:02:22,257
in such a nice restaurant atmosphere

45
00:02:24,257 --> 00:02:25,418
and you're speaking to me

46
00:02:25,418 --> 00:02:26,418
so gently.

47
00:02:27,817 --> 00:02:28,697
For this moment,

48
00:02:28,697 --> 00:02:29,377
I feel

49
00:02:30,097 --> 00:02:31,377
every effort was worthwhile.

50
00:02:32,257 --> 00:02:33,937
Why are you talking so strangely today,

51
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:34,458
Lin Tao?

52
00:02:36,298 --> 00:02:36,817
Am I?

53
00:02:37,898 --> 00:02:39,338
Stop overthinking, okay?

54
00:02:40,112 --> 00:02:41,418
What do you think I'm thinking?

55
00:02:41,777 --> 00:02:43,257
Then I'm overthinking.

56
00:02:43,657 --> 00:02:44,618
Anyway, now we are just

57
00:02:44,618 --> 00:02:45,657
good colleagues.

58
00:02:45,657 --> 00:02:46,578
Nothing more, right?

59
00:02:46,618 --> 00:02:47,458
Who says nothing?

60
00:02:51,418 --> 00:02:52,377
I worked tirelessly

61
00:02:54,298 --> 00:02:56,097
for you,

62
00:02:56,817 --> 00:02:58,138
creating that perfect

63
00:02:58,138 --> 00:02:59,738
financial report.

64
00:03:01,298 --> 00:03:03,018
I boosted Yan Studio's profits

65
00:03:03,138 --> 00:03:05,497
to 21 percent.

66
00:03:07,138 --> 00:03:08,697
That's what convinced the bank.

67
00:03:10,578 --> 00:03:11,618
Wh-What do you mean?

68
00:03:12,018 --> 00:03:14,298
With Yan Studio's current operations,

69
00:03:15,377 --> 00:03:16,497
we couldn't meet

70
00:03:16,497 --> 00:03:17,858
the bank's loan standards.

71
00:03:18,377 --> 00:03:20,298
It's all because they saw my report

72
00:03:20,298 --> 00:03:21,537
that we slipped through

73
00:03:22,298 --> 00:03:23,697
and the approval went smoothly.

74
00:03:29,338 --> 00:03:30,298
Lin Tao,

75
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,898
this counts as fraud.

76
00:03:34,497 --> 00:03:35,858
This is loan fraud.

77
00:03:36,537 --> 00:03:37,497
Not me.

78
00:03:38,578 --> 00:03:39,618
It was your sister,

79
00:03:40,418 --> 00:03:41,977
Yan Studio's legal representative,

80
00:03:42,298 --> 00:03:43,738
Xu Yan.

81
00:03:45,537 --> 00:03:46,418
What are you implying?

82
00:03:47,618 --> 00:03:48,497
What do you want?

83
00:03:48,817 --> 00:03:50,338
What I want

84
00:03:50,338 --> 00:03:51,338
has never changed.

85
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:53,298
Break up with Yu Yiming

86
00:03:54,018 --> 00:03:55,418
and marry me back home.

87
00:03:58,898 --> 00:03:59,657
Wait, Lin Tao.

88
00:04:03,097 --> 00:04:05,178
Didn't you let this go already?

89
00:04:05,338 --> 00:04:06,697
What? You were faking it?

90
00:04:08,138 --> 00:04:09,377
You've been acting all along?

91
00:04:11,298 --> 00:04:12,257
I can report you.

92
00:04:12,257 --> 00:04:13,738
I'll go report you right now.

93
00:04:13,738 --> 00:04:14,497
- I'm warning you.
- Go ahead.

94
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,377
Go right now.

95
00:04:16,577 --> 00:04:18,817
I'm just an accountant.

96
00:04:19,658 --> 00:04:21,538
Without authorization
from the legal person,

97
00:04:21,538 --> 00:04:23,017
would I dare to cook the books?

98
00:04:24,257 --> 00:04:25,697
Why would I even need to do that?

99
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:27,697
Every cent of the company

100
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:29,457
didn't enter my pocket.

101
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:30,457
Besides,

102
00:04:31,017 --> 00:04:32,137
the stamp on the report

103
00:04:32,137 --> 00:04:33,658
was applied by you, wasn't it?

104
00:04:35,298 --> 00:04:36,577
The company has surveillance.

105
00:04:37,298 --> 00:04:38,137
I checked it.

106
00:04:39,218 --> 00:04:40,738
Your stamping process

107
00:04:40,817 --> 00:04:42,298
is crystal clear.

108
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:45,017
If you dare report me,

109
00:04:45,058 --> 00:04:46,897
I'll drag Xu Yan down with me.

110
00:04:48,738 --> 00:04:51,098
The legal representative
bears primary responsibility.

111
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,858
Yan Studio is already crumbling

112
00:04:55,178 --> 00:04:56,858
under Shen Haoming's influence.

113
00:04:58,457 --> 00:05:00,618
Can you withstand
the bank's investigation?

114
00:05:02,577 --> 00:05:03,817
You're truly terrifying.

115
00:05:05,298 --> 00:05:06,218
We kindly took you in

116
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:07,538
to work at the company,

117
00:05:07,697 --> 00:05:08,618
and you repay us

118
00:05:08,618 --> 00:05:09,218
with betrayal?

119
00:05:20,377 --> 00:05:21,697
Be realistic, Lin.

120
00:05:37,377 --> 00:05:39,137
Call me despicable

121
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:41,058
or filthy,

122
00:05:42,298 --> 00:05:43,058
whatever you like.

123
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:49,232
(Balance Sheet)

124
00:05:51,778 --> 00:05:52,577
But today,

125
00:05:52,577 --> 00:05:54,017
you must make a decision.

126
00:05:55,178 --> 00:05:56,178
Right now.

127
00:05:57,058 --> 00:05:57,778
Or else,

128
00:05:58,337 --> 00:05:59,418
it's mutual destruction.

129
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:04,418
As long as you

130
00:06:06,098 --> 00:06:07,178
promise me

131
00:06:07,577 --> 00:06:08,897
that my sister

132
00:06:09,178 --> 00:06:10,298
and Yan Studio

133
00:06:10,298 --> 00:06:11,337
won't be troubled.

134
00:06:12,058 --> 00:06:14,032
(Balance Sheet)

135
00:06:15,298 --> 00:06:16,058
I'll do it.

136
00:06:25,298 --> 00:06:26,017
So,

137
00:06:27,778 --> 00:06:29,538
when will you break up with Yu Yiming?

138
00:06:33,377 --> 00:06:35,218
No need to rush this.

139
00:06:36,058 --> 00:06:37,457
Can't you give me some time?

140
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:38,497
Fine.

141
00:06:39,658 --> 00:06:40,538
One week.

142
00:06:55,497 --> 00:06:56,658
Jinsong. Jinsong.

143
00:06:56,697 --> 00:06:57,858
Quick, call the doctor!

144
00:06:57,978 --> 00:06:58,618
Doctor!

145
00:06:58,817 --> 00:06:59,257
Doctor!

146
00:06:59,257 --> 00:06:59,738
Jinsong!

147
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:00,337
Jinsong!

148
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,058
Are you okay?

149
00:07:01,098 --> 00:07:01,697
Hurry!

150
00:07:03,137 --> 00:07:03,937
Jinsong!

151
00:07:04,418 --> 00:07:04,937
How is he?

152
00:07:05,137 --> 00:07:06,218
Family members out please.

153
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:06,778
Calm down.

154
00:07:06,778 --> 00:07:07,697
Please wait outside.

155
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:09,058
You'll hinder the resuscitation.

156
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,298
- Jinsong.
- Please leave now.

157
00:07:10,457 --> 00:07:11,497
Prepare for CPR.

158
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,152
(Haoming)

159
00:07:33,402 --> 00:07:35,248
(Haoming)

160
00:07:38,697 --> 00:07:39,257
Hui,

161
00:07:39,497 --> 00:07:40,778
please look after Haochen.

162
00:07:40,897 --> 00:07:41,978
Emergency at the hospital.

163
00:07:41,978 --> 00:07:42,538
Okay.

164
00:07:46,377 --> 00:07:46,858
Mom.

165
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:50,538
You're here.

166
00:07:52,257 --> 00:07:53,178
How is he?

167
00:07:55,377 --> 00:07:57,257
His blood pressure
and pulse dropped earlier.

168
00:07:57,858 --> 00:07:58,858
It took a long time

169
00:07:58,858 --> 00:07:59,618
to bring him back.

170
00:08:01,418 --> 00:08:02,538
He just finished tests.

171
00:08:03,178 --> 00:08:04,978
All vitals are stable now.

172
00:08:07,257 --> 00:08:07,778
It's fine.

173
00:08:09,897 --> 00:08:10,858
How's Haochen?

174
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:15,978
Same as before.

175
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:22,978
Haochen can't have any more setbacks.

176
00:08:25,658 --> 00:08:26,658
Yan, I'm counting on you.

177
00:08:28,538 --> 00:08:29,017
Mom.

178
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:34,977
If you keep pushing yourself,

179
00:08:34,977 --> 00:08:36,617
your health will collapse.

180
00:08:37,577 --> 00:08:38,337
How about this?

181
00:08:38,577 --> 00:08:39,937
You go rest and be with Haochen.

182
00:08:40,178 --> 00:08:40,857
I'll stay here.

183
00:08:41,217 --> 00:08:41,778
Okay?

184
00:08:43,298 --> 00:08:43,857
Alright.

185
00:08:45,337 --> 00:08:46,258
I'll stay a bit longer.

186
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:54,977
Where's Haoming?

187
00:08:57,778 --> 00:08:58,778
He was here moments ago.

188
00:08:58,778 --> 00:09:00,337
Maybe he went to the nurses' station.

189
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:03,337
I'll go look for him.

190
00:10:07,617 --> 00:10:08,378
I know.

191
00:10:13,617 --> 00:10:15,018
I know you're hurting.

192
00:10:27,298 --> 00:10:28,097
You know.

193
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:31,937
Back in England,

194
00:10:31,937 --> 00:10:33,138
with everything that happened,

195
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:37,178
if my parents hadn't shielded me,

196
00:10:39,857 --> 00:10:40,697
I couldn't

197
00:10:40,697 --> 00:10:41,857
have handled any of it.

198
00:10:43,258 --> 00:10:44,898
But after all these years,

199
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,018
the consequences

200
00:10:46,018 --> 00:10:46,898
and responsibilities

201
00:10:46,977 --> 00:10:48,337
still fall on them.

202
00:10:53,658 --> 00:10:54,457
I understand.

203
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,217
I fully understand

204
00:10:59,977 --> 00:11:00,737
how much Jinda

205
00:11:00,737 --> 00:11:02,178
and Haochen

206
00:11:02,977 --> 00:11:04,097
mean to my father.

207
00:11:08,217 --> 00:11:10,457
Both were nurtured personally

208
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,498
by him from the ground up.

209
00:11:14,617 --> 00:11:15,857
That's why he suffered

210
00:11:15,857 --> 00:11:16,937
such a massive shock.

211
00:11:20,617 --> 00:11:21,298
I know.

212
00:11:22,937 --> 00:11:24,617
Your father greatly influenced you.

213
00:11:27,058 --> 00:11:27,817
You know.

214
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:32,817
Since childhood,

215
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,857
I've always seen him as a mountain.

216
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:41,337
No matter the crisis

217
00:11:42,178 --> 00:11:43,178
or challenge,

218
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:45,658
he could resolve anything.

219
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:48,298
All these years,

220
00:11:48,337 --> 00:11:49,697
despite constant power struggles

221
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,178
within the group,

222
00:11:53,138 --> 00:11:54,857
he balanced competing interests

223
00:11:54,898 --> 00:11:56,418
and maintained unity.

224
00:11:56,737 --> 00:11:57,977
He did it every single time.

225
00:12:02,337 --> 00:12:04,457
Nothing was beyond him.

226
00:12:07,697 --> 00:12:08,898
But I saw him just now,

227
00:12:08,898 --> 00:12:10,138
lying helplessly in that bed.

228
00:12:20,097 --> 00:12:21,298
He was so weak.

229
00:12:24,058 --> 00:12:25,457
The moment his heart stopped,

230
00:12:25,457 --> 00:12:27,138
I was absolutely terrified.

231
00:12:28,577 --> 00:12:29,337
I was afraid

232
00:12:30,977 --> 00:12:31,697
that this mountain

233
00:12:31,697 --> 00:12:32,778
would truly collapse.

234
00:12:32,898 --> 00:12:33,658
He won't.

235
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:35,538
He won't.

236
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:39,058
Father is strong.

237
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,217
He'll make it, okay?

238
00:13:47,937 --> 00:13:49,337
Not hungry again?

239
00:13:54,178 --> 00:13:55,857
You're eating so little in a day.

240
00:13:57,737 --> 00:13:59,217
Your body can't handle this.

241
00:14:01,778 --> 00:14:03,457
I will worry about you.

242
00:14:16,337 --> 00:14:16,977
I'm sorry.

243
00:14:18,498 --> 00:14:19,018
Haochen.

244
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:23,058
I apologize.

245
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:24,298
I spoke out of turn.

246
00:14:27,298 --> 00:14:28,617
But no matter what,

247
00:14:31,498 --> 00:14:33,418
we brought you up bit by bit.

248
00:14:35,248 --> 00:14:36,018
When you're happy,

249
00:14:36,697 --> 00:14:37,778
we're happy.

250
00:14:39,617 --> 00:14:40,498
When you're sad,

251
00:14:41,457 --> 00:14:42,418
we're sad too.

252
00:14:43,138 --> 00:14:44,337
Haochen, you must believe.

253
00:14:45,457 --> 00:14:46,857
Every person in this family

254
00:14:48,617 --> 00:14:50,258
loves you genuinely.

255
00:14:55,498 --> 00:14:56,258
Haochen?

256
00:15:02,658 --> 00:15:03,418
Don't you

257
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,418
like going out usually?

258
00:15:09,817 --> 00:15:11,298
Today, whatever you want to do,

259
00:15:11,817 --> 00:15:12,937
basketball,

260
00:15:13,577 --> 00:15:14,538
skateboarding,

261
00:15:15,337 --> 00:15:17,298
I'll be with you the whole time.

262
00:15:24,217 --> 00:15:25,697
Today, if we get tired

263
00:15:25,697 --> 00:15:27,058
after playing basketball,

264
00:15:27,378 --> 00:15:29,138
we'll have pizza.

265
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:30,217
And also

266
00:15:30,217 --> 00:15:31,697
your favorite ice cream,

267
00:15:31,977 --> 00:15:32,457
okay?

268
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:33,898
One scoop, two scoops.

269
00:15:33,898 --> 00:15:34,697
Whatever you want.

270
00:15:34,857 --> 00:15:35,977
After the ice-cream,

271
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,258
we'll have pizza,

272
00:15:37,898 --> 00:15:38,498
steak,

273
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,080
or fried chicken.

274
00:15:40,217 --> 00:15:40,898
It's up to you.

275
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:43,898
Stop filming me!

276
00:15:45,937 --> 00:15:46,737
Put that away!

277
00:15:46,898 --> 00:15:47,378
Security!

278
00:15:48,138 --> 00:15:48,697
Security!

279
00:15:48,977 --> 00:15:49,817
Security, hurry!

280
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:50,457
Get out!

281
00:15:50,457 --> 00:15:51,298
Out! Out! Out!

282
00:15:51,457 --> 00:15:52,298
Detain him!

283
00:15:52,778 --> 00:15:53,418
Get out now!

284
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:53,898
You okay?

285
00:15:54,298 --> 00:15:55,258
It's fine. It's fine.

286
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,058
Sweetheart.

287
00:15:56,737 --> 00:15:57,658
Quick. Take him away.

288
00:15:57,937 --> 00:15:58,817
Take him away!

289
00:15:59,778 --> 00:16:01,337
Stop filming! How dare you!

290
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:02,378
Stop filming!

291
00:16:03,058 --> 00:16:04,097
Stop filming!

292
00:16:04,258 --> 00:16:05,217
It's okay, honey.

293
00:16:05,337 --> 00:16:05,977
Haochen!

294
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:07,138
Handle this now!

295
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:07,817
Don't worry.

296
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:08,817
Haochen!

297
00:16:10,097 --> 00:16:11,018
Haochen!

298
00:16:11,658 --> 00:16:12,624
Haochen, open the door.

299
00:16:12,937 --> 00:16:13,617
Open up.

300
00:16:13,697 --> 00:16:14,352
What happened?

301
00:16:15,018 --> 00:16:15,977
You're finally back.

302
00:16:16,138 --> 00:16:16,737
I tried

303
00:16:16,737 --> 00:16:17,298
taking him out

304
00:16:17,298 --> 00:16:18,217
to cheer him up today.

305
00:16:18,217 --> 00:16:20,577
We got snapped right there,
not sure if it was a reporter.

306
00:16:20,577 --> 00:16:21,697
- Take it easy.
- He pointed it

307
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:22,457
right at us,

308
00:16:22,457 --> 00:16:23,418
filming shamelessly.

309
00:16:23,577 --> 00:16:25,018
Then Haochen got upset,

310
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:25,658
ran inside,

311
00:16:25,658 --> 00:16:27,097
and locked the door.

312
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:29,258
Haochen.

313
00:16:30,577 --> 00:16:31,418
- Open the door!
- He...

314
00:16:31,418 --> 00:16:33,097
He was crying. Why is it silent now?

315
00:16:33,217 --> 00:16:33,778
Haochen!

316
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:34,457
Haochen!

317
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:35,097
Haochen!

318
00:16:37,058 --> 00:16:37,778
Mom, step back.

319
00:16:40,898 --> 00:16:41,538
Haochen.

320
00:16:42,817 --> 00:16:43,577
Haochen!

321
00:16:44,498 --> 00:16:45,298
Haochen!

322
00:16:45,737 --> 00:16:46,977
Haochen, what's wrong with you?

323
00:16:47,018 --> 00:16:47,658
Haochen!

324
00:16:47,817 --> 00:16:48,817
Call Dr. Wang. Hurry.

325
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:49,857
Dr. Wa...

326
00:16:51,658 --> 00:16:52,138
Haochen.

327
00:16:53,217 --> 00:16:53,697
Haochen.

328
00:16:56,778 --> 00:16:57,418
Hello? Hello?

329
00:16:57,538 --> 00:16:58,058
Wang,

330
00:16:58,138 --> 00:16:58,817
Haochen fainted.

331
00:16:58,817 --> 00:16:59,697
Come to my place now.

332
00:16:59,817 --> 00:17:00,977
Hurry! Yes.

333
00:17:02,617 --> 00:17:03,378
Haochen!

334
00:17:18,377 --> 00:17:19,058
Dr. Wang.

335
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,577
What's Haochen's

336
00:17:20,577 --> 00:17:21,897
current condition?

337
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:22,897
Nothing serious.

338
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,258
He fainted

339
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:26,538
due to low blood sugar
from not eating enough.

340
00:17:27,657 --> 00:17:28,938
You don't know him well.

341
00:17:28,938 --> 00:17:30,097
He refuses to eat anything.

342
00:17:30,577 --> 00:17:31,577
What should we do?

343
00:17:32,698 --> 00:17:34,177
Due to emotional distress,

344
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:35,617
now Haochen

345
00:17:35,617 --> 00:17:37,657
has had mild autism.

346
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:39,417
That's why he refuses to eat

347
00:17:39,498 --> 00:17:40,298
and communicate.

348
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,657
Mild cases can be cured.

349
00:17:41,897 --> 00:17:42,897
If it becomes severe,

350
00:17:43,218 --> 00:17:44,258
he might show signs

351
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:45,258
of self-harm

352
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:46,377
or aggressive behaviors.

353
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,417
Parents should intervene early.

354
00:17:48,698 --> 00:17:49,698
Are there any solutions?

355
00:17:50,498 --> 00:17:52,657
Haochen is very resistant
to his environment right now.

356
00:17:53,218 --> 00:17:53,857
I think

357
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:54,978
he needs

358
00:17:55,258 --> 00:17:56,058
a totally new

359
00:17:56,058 --> 00:17:56,978
environment for now.

360
00:17:58,817 --> 00:17:59,938
Understood. Thank you.

361
00:18:00,018 --> 00:18:00,417
Okay.

362
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:01,577
I'll check on him again.

363
00:18:01,857 --> 00:18:02,817
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

364
00:18:08,738 --> 00:18:10,218
Haoming, Yan,

365
00:18:10,704 --> 00:18:12,080
let's follow the doctor's advice

366
00:18:12,377 --> 00:18:13,938
and take Haochen to a new environment.

367
00:18:14,337 --> 00:18:15,258
Anywhere will do.

368
00:18:17,258 --> 00:18:17,778
Mom,

369
00:18:18,978 --> 00:18:20,137
Dad's in the hospital now.

370
00:18:20,177 --> 00:18:21,298
Don't worry about Dad.

371
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:22,817
His condition has stabilized.

372
00:18:22,817 --> 00:18:23,417
I'm here.

373
00:18:23,498 --> 00:18:24,377
Don't worry. I'm here.

374
00:18:24,377 --> 00:18:25,698
Haochen's situation is urgent.

375
00:18:27,577 --> 00:18:29,377
So going abroad? Somewhere far away?

376
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:29,938
Good idea.

377
00:18:31,058 --> 00:18:32,417
But not too far.

378
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,218
If anything happens to Dad,

379
00:18:35,888 --> 00:18:37,337
we might not make it back in time.

380
00:18:41,778 --> 00:18:43,097
So where's better?

381
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,897
How about my grandma's house?

382
00:18:49,817 --> 00:18:50,377
Is that okay?

383
00:18:51,738 --> 00:18:52,857
Is it convenient? Because...

384
00:18:53,097 --> 00:18:53,738
Very convenient.

385
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,657
She lives in the countryside.

386
00:18:55,738 --> 00:18:56,698
It's spacious there,

387
00:18:56,817 --> 00:18:57,857
with many animals.

388
00:18:58,018 --> 00:18:59,058
Kids love that.

389
00:19:02,817 --> 00:19:03,897
Let's follow Yan's advice.

390
00:19:04,738 --> 00:19:05,744
The hospital has nurses,

391
00:19:06,018 --> 00:19:06,978
and Hui's at home.

392
00:19:07,617 --> 00:19:09,018
Leave Dad's matters to me.

393
00:19:09,978 --> 00:19:11,137
Haochen's situation really

394
00:19:11,337 --> 00:19:12,498
can't be delayed any longer.

395
00:19:12,657 --> 00:19:13,258
Understood.

396
00:19:14,298 --> 00:19:14,857
I'll call

397
00:19:14,857 --> 00:19:15,778
my grandma right away.

398
00:19:15,857 --> 00:19:16,538
Mom, don't worry.

399
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:18,864
We leave tomorrow.

400
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:32,817
I told you

401
00:19:32,857 --> 00:19:34,177
not to wait outside.

402
00:19:34,498 --> 00:19:35,377
Yan!

403
00:19:35,657 --> 00:19:37,657
I missed you so much!

404
00:19:37,897 --> 00:19:38,617
Hello, Grandma.

405
00:19:39,617 --> 00:19:40,498
How are you lately?

406
00:19:40,498 --> 00:19:41,377
Good.

407
00:19:41,657 --> 00:19:42,857
Already in great shape,

408
00:19:42,938 --> 00:19:44,817
and even better seeing you all.

409
00:19:44,938 --> 00:19:45,577
That's great.

410
00:19:47,258 --> 00:19:48,978
This must be Haochen?

411
00:19:50,538 --> 00:19:52,137
What a handsome little fellow.

412
00:19:52,377 --> 00:19:54,058
Haochen, say hello to Great-grandma.

413
00:19:58,258 --> 00:19:58,857
Haochen.

414
00:20:01,298 --> 00:20:01,857
Never mind.

415
00:20:02,177 --> 00:20:04,298
He just arrived. He's shy.

416
00:20:04,657 --> 00:20:06,938
After getting familiar,
he'll call me naturally.

417
00:20:07,738 --> 00:20:08,417
Haochen.

418
00:20:12,738 --> 00:20:14,538
Come on. Give the suitcase to me.

419
00:20:14,657 --> 00:20:15,778
Follow me.

420
00:20:16,738 --> 00:20:17,538
Come on.

421
00:20:17,577 --> 00:20:18,577
Watch your step.

422
00:20:18,657 --> 00:20:20,258
Don't look around.

423
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:21,897
You'll have plenty to see later.

424
00:20:22,738 --> 00:20:23,938
When we get home,

425
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:26,538
I will cook delicious meals for you.

426
00:20:28,778 --> 00:20:29,177
Come on.

427
00:20:30,417 --> 00:20:31,417
Eat more, Haochen.

428
00:20:31,738 --> 00:20:33,218
I made this

429
00:20:33,577 --> 00:20:34,577
braised pork knuckle.

430
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:37,817
- And this beef stew.
- Vinegar?

431
00:20:38,218 --> 00:20:39,498
I spent three to four hours

432
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:41,258
simmering it.

433
00:20:41,498 --> 00:20:42,657
It melts in your mouth.

434
00:20:43,058 --> 00:20:44,498
How does the commercial say it?

435
00:20:44,897 --> 00:20:46,218
It tastes wonderful!

436
00:20:50,857 --> 00:20:52,498
You like the sliced noodles?

437
00:20:52,978 --> 00:20:54,498
These are special.

438
00:20:54,897 --> 00:20:58,018
It resembles silver fish
diving into waves

439
00:20:58,377 --> 00:21:00,657
and willow leaves
riding the wind from branches.

440
00:21:01,298 --> 00:21:02,657
If you visit Shanxi

441
00:21:02,738 --> 00:21:03,657
and don't eat a bowl

442
00:21:03,657 --> 00:21:04,897
of these noodles,

443
00:21:05,058 --> 00:21:06,177
it's a wasted trip.

444
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:08,617
Haochen,

445
00:21:09,258 --> 00:21:10,018
all these dishes

446
00:21:10,538 --> 00:21:11,417
were prepared

447
00:21:11,498 --> 00:21:12,458
by Great-grandma.

448
00:21:13,018 --> 00:21:14,018
Come on. Eat up.

449
00:21:19,377 --> 00:21:20,097
Haochen?

450
00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:23,018
Don't.

451
00:21:26,817 --> 00:21:27,817
Sorry, Grandma.

452
00:21:28,177 --> 00:21:29,538
He's usually very polite.

453
00:21:30,258 --> 00:21:31,177
It's fine.

454
00:21:31,577 --> 00:21:32,778
He's just a child.

455
00:21:34,058 --> 00:21:35,258
Don't force him

456
00:21:35,258 --> 00:21:37,177
if he can't finish. He just arrived.

457
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:39,337
Besides, Yan

458
00:21:39,897 --> 00:21:41,738
already told me before you came.

459
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:43,978
We adults

460
00:21:44,298 --> 00:21:45,377
all understand

461
00:21:45,617 --> 00:21:46,857
children's feelings,

462
00:21:47,218 --> 00:21:47,817
right?

463
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:52,177
Leave some for him.

464
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:53,657
Leave some.

465
00:21:54,337 --> 00:21:55,218
No need.

466
00:21:55,617 --> 00:21:56,698
I'll cook fresh

467
00:21:56,778 --> 00:21:57,738
whenever he's hungry.

468
00:21:59,337 --> 00:22:00,377
You all eat now.

469
00:22:00,857 --> 00:22:01,738
Have some fish.

470
00:22:02,817 --> 00:22:03,258
Let's eat.

471
00:22:05,817 --> 00:22:06,377
Eat up.

472
00:22:06,377 --> 00:22:06,738
Okay.

473
00:22:32,538 --> 00:22:33,177
Yan,

474
00:22:34,177 --> 00:22:35,617
when I was hospitalized last time

475
00:22:35,617 --> 00:22:36,938
and you rushed back to see me,

476
00:22:37,938 --> 00:22:39,177
I realized

477
00:22:39,857 --> 00:22:41,577
something was wrong
between you and Haoming.

478
00:22:42,337 --> 00:22:43,778
But seeing you two

479
00:22:43,817 --> 00:22:45,018
get along so well now

480
00:22:45,938 --> 00:22:47,577
reassures me.

481
00:22:50,738 --> 00:22:51,337
So

482
00:22:51,817 --> 00:22:52,897
let me ask you.

483
00:22:54,137 --> 00:22:56,298
Was your previous conflict

484
00:22:57,258 --> 00:22:58,778
about him

485
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:00,498
having a child?

486
00:23:09,218 --> 00:23:09,738
Grandma,

487
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,377
I genuinely care for Haochen.

488
00:23:16,337 --> 00:23:17,538
He's such

489
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:21,177
a smart, loyal and sensitive child.

490
00:23:21,897 --> 00:23:23,058
Before, he'd chat with me

491
00:23:23,058 --> 00:23:23,978
for hours.

492
00:23:25,298 --> 00:23:26,337
But now,

493
00:23:26,337 --> 00:23:27,377
he's completely silent.

494
00:23:31,938 --> 00:23:33,337
It hurts to see him like this.

495
00:23:35,897 --> 00:23:37,778
I brought him here

496
00:23:38,978 --> 00:23:39,897
to give him

497
00:23:39,897 --> 00:23:41,417
an adjustment period.

498
00:23:41,738 --> 00:23:42,577
He's a kid.

499
00:23:43,617 --> 00:23:45,298
He needs some time

500
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:47,817
to process sudden life changes.

501
00:23:49,337 --> 00:23:50,218
I really don't know

502
00:23:50,218 --> 00:23:51,137
what else I should do.

503
00:23:52,258 --> 00:23:53,698
I just want to care for him

504
00:23:56,097 --> 00:23:56,978
and help him become

505
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:57,897
his old self again.

506
00:23:59,978 --> 00:24:00,897
Yan,

507
00:24:02,857 --> 00:24:04,817
that's the right approach.

508
00:24:06,617 --> 00:24:08,417
Beyond blood relations,

509
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:09,738
what matters more

510
00:24:10,337 --> 00:24:13,137
and truly connects people

511
00:24:13,738 --> 00:24:16,097
is mutual sincerity.

512
00:24:18,698 --> 00:24:19,258
Grandma,

513
00:24:19,698 --> 00:24:21,337
don't worry about us.

514
00:24:22,177 --> 00:24:24,617
We're being completely transparent
with each other now.

515
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:28,258
We'll solve problems
and face them together.

516
00:24:30,897 --> 00:24:33,058
With you as our shelter,

517
00:24:33,817 --> 00:24:35,617
we'll overcome everything.

518
00:24:39,538 --> 00:24:39,978
Mom,

519
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:41,698
how's Dad?

520
00:24:42,657 --> 00:24:44,018
He's stable in all aspects.

521
00:24:44,377 --> 00:24:45,538
He hasn't woken up yet.

522
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:47,137
But the doctor said

523
00:24:47,377 --> 00:24:48,337
it is optimistic.

524
00:24:48,498 --> 00:24:49,617
No need to worry.

525
00:24:50,218 --> 00:24:50,978
That's good.

526
00:24:52,577 --> 00:24:53,978
Take turns with the caregivers.

527
00:24:54,384 --> 00:24:55,504
Don't keep staying up late.

528
00:24:56,377 --> 00:24:56,897
Okay.

529
00:24:57,298 --> 00:24:57,978
Don't worry.

530
00:24:58,978 --> 00:24:59,978
How's Haochen?

531
00:25:00,817 --> 00:25:01,617
Same as before.

532
00:25:02,177 --> 00:25:03,097
He still won't talk.

533
00:25:04,498 --> 00:25:05,577
Hopefully after some time,

534
00:25:06,377 --> 00:25:07,337
he'll improve.

535
00:25:07,857 --> 00:25:08,458
Alright.

536
00:25:09,137 --> 00:25:11,417
Take care over there.

537
00:25:12,218 --> 00:25:12,698
Okay.

538
00:25:24,738 --> 00:25:26,337
Haochen, breakfast is ready.

539
00:25:30,298 --> 00:25:30,938
Haochen?

540
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,538
Good morning.

541
00:25:34,577 --> 00:25:35,177
He's out.

542
00:25:36,097 --> 00:25:36,698
Sleep well?

543
00:25:37,377 --> 00:25:38,857
Any mosquitoes last night?

544
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:40,938
Come on.

545
00:25:42,817 --> 00:25:43,298
Look.

546
00:25:43,897 --> 00:25:45,417
Great-grandma made this for you.

547
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:47,058
Sesame oil egg.

548
00:25:47,177 --> 00:25:48,177
Smell how fragrant it is.

549
00:25:50,177 --> 00:25:51,897
Let's have it with a steamed bun.

550
00:26:04,778 --> 00:26:05,978
You barely ate last night.

551
00:26:06,058 --> 00:26:06,817
Eat a bit more now.

552
00:26:06,817 --> 00:26:07,298
Haochen,

553
00:26:07,498 --> 00:26:08,377
it's delicious.

554
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:08,938
Haochen?

555
00:26:09,657 --> 00:26:10,177
Haochen.

556
00:26:11,218 --> 00:26:12,018
Since you're done,

557
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:13,177
go do some work.

558
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:17,177
Haoming,

559
00:26:17,258 --> 00:26:18,738
you should finish your meal too.

560
00:26:18,938 --> 00:26:19,577
After eating,

561
00:26:19,698 --> 00:26:21,458
get a big basket from the yard

562
00:26:21,657 --> 00:26:22,417
and take the kid

563
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:24,218
to harvest corn on the back hill.

564
00:26:29,698 --> 00:26:30,137
Okay.

565
00:26:30,617 --> 00:26:31,097
Understood.

566
00:26:33,498 --> 00:26:34,698
We country folks

567
00:26:34,698 --> 00:26:36,018
have one rule.

568
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:38,058
Only those too old to work

569
00:26:38,337 --> 00:26:40,337
or infants unable to work

570
00:26:40,938 --> 00:26:42,058
can be exempt from labor.

571
00:26:42,177 --> 00:26:43,498
Everyone else can't rest.

572
00:26:43,538 --> 00:26:44,738
They must work the fields.

573
00:26:46,337 --> 00:26:47,698
You're living in my house

574
00:26:47,698 --> 00:26:48,577
and eating my food.

575
00:26:48,617 --> 00:26:50,498
Labor is mandatory.

576
00:26:50,698 --> 00:26:51,857
Grandma,

577
00:26:51,897 --> 00:26:53,097
don't be like this.

578
00:26:53,577 --> 00:26:55,897
Haochen is just a child.

579
00:26:56,218 --> 00:26:56,577
He...

580
00:26:56,817 --> 00:26:59,058
He can't possibly handle this work.

581
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,337
He's quite temperamental.

582
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:15,698
Brilliant.

583
00:27:17,377 --> 00:27:18,058
I'll go too.

584
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,177
You haven't finished yet.

585
00:27:21,298 --> 00:27:22,337
Get one for him too.

586
00:27:22,458 --> 00:27:23,377
Get him one too.

587
00:27:23,577 --> 00:27:23,978
Okay.

588
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,337
Let me show you.

589
00:27:39,698 --> 00:27:41,177
Corn harvesting goes like this.

590
00:27:47,698 --> 00:27:48,577
Press down.

591
00:27:49,617 --> 00:27:51,097
Twist clockwise and it comes off.

592
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:52,018
Press down.

593
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:53,897
Twist clockwise. Off it comes.

594
00:27:56,377 --> 00:27:57,657
Simple as that.

595
00:27:58,137 --> 00:27:59,498
Press down.

596
00:28:00,337 --> 00:28:01,137
Twist.

597
00:28:01,698 --> 00:28:02,218
Comes off.

598
00:28:08,698 --> 00:28:10,298
Press down and twist.

599
00:28:11,577 --> 00:28:12,592
The whole corn comes off.

600
00:28:15,377 --> 00:28:16,058
Try that one.

601
00:28:22,538 --> 00:28:24,857
Press down and twist.

602
00:28:46,938 --> 00:28:48,018
There's more over there.

603
00:28:48,417 --> 00:28:48,938
Go up.

604
00:28:49,657 --> 00:28:50,258
Up higher.

605
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:53,298
No, no, no.

606
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:55,738
Catch it. Catch it.

607
00:28:55,897 --> 00:28:56,337
Catch!

608
00:28:56,417 --> 00:28:57,258
Use hands!

609
00:28:57,498 --> 00:28:58,458
Use your hands to catch.

610
00:28:58,938 --> 00:28:59,778
Come out of the coop!

611
00:29:04,738 --> 00:29:05,137
Catch!

612
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:08,498
Catch it! Catch it!

613
00:29:09,258 --> 00:29:10,218
Got it! I got it!

614
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:11,337
Haochen, take it!

615
00:29:11,377 --> 00:29:11,857
Quick!

616
00:29:11,897 --> 00:29:13,738
Hurry! Hurry!

617
00:29:31,538 --> 00:29:32,817
You're dragging your feet

618
00:29:32,857 --> 00:29:34,218
on such a small task.

619
00:29:34,417 --> 00:29:34,938
Do you plan

620
00:29:34,938 --> 00:29:36,298
to finish it when it's dark?

621
00:29:37,538 --> 00:29:38,617
Why are you staring?

622
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:40,298
Let me tell you.

623
00:29:40,377 --> 00:29:41,498
All these corns

624
00:29:41,538 --> 00:29:43,258
must be processed before sunset.

625
00:29:56,688 --> 00:29:57,328
How about this?

626
00:29:58,538 --> 00:29:59,577
You handle that pile.

627
00:30:00,097 --> 00:30:01,018
These two are mine.

628
00:30:16,897 --> 00:30:17,377
Okay.

629
00:30:17,577 --> 00:30:18,698
Here, take it.

630
00:30:56,657 --> 00:30:57,298
Haochen,

631
00:30:57,778 --> 00:30:59,617
do you want another bowl?

632
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:04,377
Go to the kitchen

633
00:31:04,624 --> 00:31:05,458
and serve yourself.

634
00:31:17,738 --> 00:31:18,577
Farm work

635
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:19,738
really works.

636
00:31:20,978 --> 00:31:21,938
Second serve already.

637
00:31:23,778 --> 00:31:24,738
Remember to tell Mom

638
00:31:25,298 --> 00:31:26,337
about the good news.

639
00:31:26,538 --> 00:31:27,058
Definitely.

640
00:31:28,058 --> 00:31:29,337
Won't this cause indigestion?

641
00:31:40,258 --> 00:31:41,097
Let me help you.

642
00:31:41,177 --> 00:31:41,657
Let me help.

643
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:48,058
Come on.

644
00:31:52,337 --> 00:31:53,738
Meat lover should eat more.

645
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:57,857
Eat more meat.

646
00:31:58,097 --> 00:31:58,897
This kid...

647
00:32:01,218 --> 00:32:01,776
His belly...

648
00:32:09,097 --> 00:32:10,298
Though we've now

649
00:32:10,698 --> 00:32:11,738
removed Shen Jinsong

650
00:32:11,738 --> 00:32:13,258
and Shen Haoming from their positions,

651
00:32:15,218 --> 00:32:16,817
they remain the company's

652
00:32:16,938 --> 00:32:17,698
major shareholders.

653
00:32:18,058 --> 00:32:20,258
The board and department heads

654
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,377
are all waiting to see

655
00:32:24,177 --> 00:32:25,498
when they'll make a comeback.

656
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:29,617
What's your take?

657
00:32:35,177 --> 00:32:37,177
Due to their personal misconduct,

658
00:32:37,377 --> 00:32:38,857
our stock prices plummeted,

659
00:32:39,097 --> 00:32:40,538
causing massive financial losses.

660
00:32:42,657 --> 00:32:43,538
Legally speaking,

661
00:32:44,258 --> 00:32:45,498
the group has full authority

662
00:32:45,978 --> 00:32:47,337
to demand compensation from them.

663
00:32:47,978 --> 00:32:49,137
We can gather

664
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:51,377
eligible shareholders

665
00:32:52,432 --> 00:32:53,808
to represent the group

666
00:32:53,808 --> 00:32:56,177
in suing those two

667
00:32:56,657 --> 00:32:57,978
and demand they repay the losses.

668
00:32:59,137 --> 00:33:01,298
Meanwhile, file
for litigation preservation

669
00:33:01,657 --> 00:33:02,817
to freeze their accounts.

670
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:04,498
A legal battle?

671
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:07,817
It has lengthy cycles.

672
00:33:08,258 --> 00:33:09,817
The longer, the better.

673
00:33:10,617 --> 00:33:11,738
Once preservation is enacted

674
00:33:12,097 --> 00:33:13,258
and their accounts frozen,

675
00:33:13,857 --> 00:33:14,857
all their stocks

676
00:33:15,337 --> 00:33:16,617
become worthless paper.

677
00:33:17,337 --> 00:33:18,137
Without funds,

678
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:19,698
how could they come back?

679
00:33:34,058 --> 00:33:34,538
Senior,

680
00:33:34,698 --> 00:33:36,738
the patient in Bed 3
has surgery scheduled Friday.

681
00:33:38,978 --> 00:33:39,498
Lin?

682
00:33:42,698 --> 00:33:43,498
You're back.

683
00:33:46,337 --> 00:33:47,498
Are you going out?

684
00:33:47,657 --> 00:33:48,097
Yeah,

685
00:33:48,137 --> 00:33:50,137
I need to return to the office.

686
00:33:52,657 --> 00:33:54,097
Have you been avoiding me lately?

687
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:56,137
Why would I do that? I'm not.

688
00:34:01,097 --> 00:34:01,577
Lin.

689
00:34:04,018 --> 00:34:05,058
I know you're busy lately,

690
00:34:06,417 --> 00:34:07,897
but you only text two-word replies.

691
00:34:08,378 --> 00:34:09,617
Calls last less than a minute.

692
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:11,858
When I offer
to pick you up, you decline.

693
00:34:13,808 --> 00:34:14,818
What's really going on?

694
00:34:16,418 --> 00:34:17,697
You're overthinking.

695
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:19,898
I've just

696
00:34:19,978 --> 00:34:21,058
been too busy lately.

697
00:34:21,257 --> 00:34:22,617
I'm too occupied.

698
00:34:24,177 --> 00:34:24,978
Look,

699
00:34:25,257 --> 00:34:26,657
I finally left work early today,

700
00:34:26,657 --> 00:34:28,058
hoping to rest,

701
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,552
but they called and dragged me back.

702
00:34:30,297 --> 00:34:31,217
It's genuinely chaotic.

703
00:34:31,938 --> 00:34:33,018
I have much to do.

704
00:34:33,018 --> 00:34:33,978
You go rest first.

705
00:34:34,177 --> 00:34:35,418
I'll update you later.

706
00:34:35,697 --> 00:34:36,137
Go back.

707
00:34:36,137 --> 00:34:36,617
Really?

708
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:37,338
Really.

709
00:34:41,418 --> 00:34:42,257
It's not too bad.

710
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:43,498
Just a minor sprain.

711
00:34:44,858 --> 00:34:46,458
Apply cold compress when you go back.

712
00:34:46,657 --> 00:34:47,938
Then use the medicinal oil

713
00:34:47,978 --> 00:34:48,898
and massage the ankle.

714
00:34:48,898 --> 00:34:50,032
It'll be fine in a few days.

715
00:34:50,378 --> 00:34:51,217
Thank you, doctor.

716
00:34:53,097 --> 00:34:54,538
The swelling looks significant.

717
00:34:56,938 --> 00:34:57,538
It's my fault.

718
00:34:57,777 --> 00:34:58,777
I didn't catch you.

719
00:34:59,018 --> 00:34:59,577
No, no.

720
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:00,818
I just lost my balance.

721
00:35:03,257 --> 00:35:04,018
Maybe you should

722
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:04,818
take some days off

723
00:35:05,392 --> 00:35:06,217
and work from home.

724
00:35:06,978 --> 00:35:07,538
No need.

725
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:08,898
It's not a serious injury.

726
00:35:09,018 --> 00:35:10,498
With so many things in the company,

727
00:35:10,538 --> 00:35:11,538
I still need to go.

728
00:35:12,137 --> 00:35:12,617
Lin,

729
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:13,938
are you okay?

730
00:35:14,297 --> 00:35:15,018
I looked for you

731
00:35:15,378 --> 00:35:16,418
and heard from security.

732
00:35:16,978 --> 00:35:17,617
How did you

733
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:18,577
end up falling?

734
00:35:19,018 --> 00:35:19,978
It must hurt terribly.

735
00:35:20,177 --> 00:35:20,938
Let me see.

736
00:35:22,097 --> 00:35:22,858
I'm fine. Really.

737
00:35:22,858 --> 00:35:23,538
What you doing?

738
00:35:26,177 --> 00:35:27,177
You're injured.

739
00:35:27,177 --> 00:35:28,657
Why are you carrying this yourself?

740
00:35:28,858 --> 00:35:29,538
Dr. Yu,

741
00:35:29,818 --> 00:35:30,577
thank you.

742
00:35:30,858 --> 00:35:31,818
Leave the rest to me.

743
00:35:32,272 --> 00:35:33,297
Are you out of your mind?

744
00:35:34,058 --> 00:35:35,257
What's wrong with you?

745
00:35:35,617 --> 00:35:36,577
This is my girlfriend.

746
00:35:39,418 --> 00:35:39,938
Lin,

747
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:42,577
you didn't tell him?

748
00:35:45,297 --> 00:35:46,058
Tell me what?

749
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:48,458
Qiao Lin is now my girlfriend.

750
00:35:48,752 --> 00:35:49,538
Don't believe me?

751
00:35:50,978 --> 00:35:51,938
Ask her yourself then.

752
00:36:04,898 --> 00:36:05,418
Lin,

753
00:36:05,737 --> 00:36:06,378
let me help you.

754
00:36:09,818 --> 00:36:10,818
Thank you, doctor.

755
00:36:11,898 --> 00:36:12,297
Lin,

756
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,418
let's go. I'll help you.

757
00:36:13,697 --> 00:36:14,217
No need.

758
00:36:14,818 --> 00:36:15,297
Lin,

759
00:36:15,657 --> 00:36:16,378
tell me the truth.

760
00:36:17,338 --> 00:36:17,978
Back off.

761
00:36:18,378 --> 00:36:18,938
Yu Yiming,

762
00:36:19,217 --> 00:36:20,217
this is your workplace.

763
00:36:20,617 --> 00:36:22,217
You'll regret it if you start a fight.

764
00:36:26,097 --> 00:36:26,617
Lin,

765
00:36:28,137 --> 00:36:29,217
are you hiding something?

766
00:36:32,978 --> 00:36:34,297
What kind of nonsense is that?

767
00:36:34,737 --> 00:36:36,577
We're in a proper relationship.

768
00:36:36,938 --> 00:36:38,058
We're deeply connected.

769
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:39,898
True lovers always find their way.

770
00:36:40,378 --> 00:36:41,538
What do we need to hide?

771
00:36:41,737 --> 00:36:42,498
Get out of my way.

772
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:45,617
I need to talk to Qiao Lin now.

773
00:36:48,617 --> 00:36:49,177
Lin,

774
00:36:50,177 --> 00:36:52,097
make it clear to him once and for all.

775
00:36:52,938 --> 00:36:54,137
Make him give up completely.

776
00:36:59,697 --> 00:37:00,498
Lin Tao and I

777
00:37:02,418 --> 00:37:03,498
are back together.

778
00:37:16,137 --> 00:37:16,858
That's impossible.

779
00:37:19,978 --> 00:37:20,657
Yu Yiming,

780
00:37:22,217 --> 00:37:23,577
the time I spent with you

781
00:37:23,577 --> 00:37:24,737
was truly joyful.

782
00:37:27,257 --> 00:37:28,498
But marriage and dating

783
00:37:28,498 --> 00:37:29,538
are two different things.

784
00:37:32,137 --> 00:37:33,498
I've thought long and hard.

785
00:37:34,818 --> 00:37:36,217
There are significant gaps

786
00:37:36,257 --> 00:37:37,338
between us.

787
00:37:38,577 --> 00:37:39,777
These are practical realities.

788
00:37:43,657 --> 00:37:44,577
As for Lin Tao,

789
00:37:45,538 --> 00:37:46,257
his devotion

790
00:37:46,257 --> 00:37:47,458
has truly moved me.

791
00:37:47,697 --> 00:37:49,498
After much consideration,

792
00:37:50,498 --> 00:37:51,097
I believe

793
00:37:52,378 --> 00:37:53,458
he's more suitable for me.

794
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:00,018
I don't believe

795
00:38:00,018 --> 00:38:01,018
anything you just said.

796
00:38:02,177 --> 00:38:03,338
What really happened?

797
00:38:04,577 --> 00:38:05,577
If he threatened you...

798
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:06,297
Yu Yiming,

799
00:38:06,657 --> 00:38:07,777
if you touch my girl again,

800
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:09,018
I'll hit you. I swear.

801
00:38:09,097 --> 00:38:10,458
Lin Tao, that's enough!

802
00:38:19,617 --> 00:38:20,297
Yu Yiming,

803
00:38:20,697 --> 00:38:21,498
believe it or not,

804
00:38:21,498 --> 00:38:22,858
I've said everything that needed

805
00:38:22,858 --> 00:38:23,818
to be said today.

806
00:38:25,378 --> 00:38:26,418
Don't come to me anymore.

807
00:38:27,058 --> 00:38:27,617
Lin,

808
00:38:28,737 --> 00:38:30,297
now that everything's out in the open,

809
00:38:31,458 --> 00:38:32,697
return what you owe him.

810
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:34,978
So he won't bother you again.

811
00:38:41,818 --> 00:38:43,137
This ring was also given by you.

812
00:38:47,137 --> 00:38:47,777
Take it back.

813
00:38:50,777 --> 00:38:51,697
Now we're even.

814
00:39:20,617 --> 00:39:21,657
Haochen,

815
00:39:23,058 --> 00:39:24,097
what are you looking at?

816
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:28,538
You like animals too?

817
00:39:29,338 --> 00:39:30,338
Great.

818
00:39:30,777 --> 00:39:32,217
From now on, these chicks

819
00:39:32,498 --> 00:39:33,697
will be your responsibility.

820
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:35,538
Actually, taking care of them

821
00:39:35,538 --> 00:39:36,617
is pretty simple.

822
00:39:36,818 --> 00:39:37,858
You just need

823
00:39:38,257 --> 00:39:39,297
to feed them

824
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:40,697
regularly every day.

825
00:39:42,058 --> 00:39:43,458
That's about it.

826
00:39:44,418 --> 00:39:45,338
And also

827
00:39:46,338 --> 00:39:47,657
clean their living area

828
00:39:47,737 --> 00:39:48,978
thoroughly every day.

829
00:39:49,058 --> 00:39:49,737
Keep it tidy.

830
00:39:50,338 --> 00:39:50,737
Okay?

831
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:52,378
Simple enough, right?

832
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:53,257
Here.

833
00:39:53,737 --> 00:39:54,657
Take this.

834
00:39:55,338 --> 00:39:56,137
Three meals a day

835
00:39:56,177 --> 00:39:57,217
are your job now.

836
00:39:57,257 --> 00:39:58,257
If they get hungry,

837
00:39:58,297 --> 00:39:59,418
I'll hold you accountable.

838
00:40:00,697 --> 00:40:01,217
Get to work.

839
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:40,432
(Xu Yan)

840
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:53,097
Yan.

841
00:40:53,737 --> 00:40:55,137
I saw the payment went through.

842
00:40:55,657 --> 00:40:56,097
Yes.

843
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:58,137
The loan funds have arrived.

844
00:40:58,697 --> 00:40:59,137
Also

845
00:40:59,297 --> 00:41:01,297
the physical store is progressing.

846
00:41:01,297 --> 00:41:02,577
Though it might

847
00:41:02,617 --> 00:41:03,818
not move as quickly.

848
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:06,297
Don't worry.

849
00:41:06,938 --> 00:41:08,818
I'll take care of both
the company and home.

850
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:09,657
Okay.

851
00:41:09,904 --> 00:41:10,898
Then I'll count on you.

852
00:41:12,338 --> 00:41:12,898
Thank you.

853
00:41:13,072 --> 00:41:13,818
You too.

854
00:41:14,297 --> 00:41:14,737
Bye.

855
00:41:15,217 --> 00:41:15,737
Bye.

856
00:41:41,257 --> 00:41:42,018
Be careful

857
00:41:42,018 --> 00:41:42,978
with this mirror too.

858
00:41:43,018 --> 00:41:43,418
Lin.

859
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:43,898
Thank you.

860
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:46,858
Lin.

861
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:54,777
What is it?

862
00:41:57,018 --> 00:41:58,018
Are you moving out?

863
00:42:00,097 --> 00:42:00,898
Where to?

864
00:42:01,617 --> 00:42:02,657
T-To my sister's place.

865
00:42:05,538 --> 00:42:06,538
No matter how I ask,

866
00:42:06,704 --> 00:42:07,978
you refuse to tell the truth.

867
00:42:07,978 --> 00:42:08,418
Is that so?

868
00:42:09,177 --> 00:42:10,297
There's no truth to tell.

869
00:42:10,297 --> 00:42:10,737
Just...

870
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:13,177
I told you. I've just
had a change of heart.

871
00:42:15,538 --> 00:42:17,297
I don't care how many times
you've said it

872
00:42:18,338 --> 00:42:19,297
or what I've seen

873
00:42:19,297 --> 00:42:19,898
or heard.

874
00:42:20,097 --> 00:42:22,338
Even if you are with Lin Tao
and push me away,

875
00:42:23,378 --> 00:42:25,058
I'll never believe
you've changed feelings.

876
00:42:32,297 --> 00:42:33,217
If you'd seen

877
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:35,577
how you looked at me,

878
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,737
you'd understand
why I'm certain of this.

879
00:42:41,257 --> 00:42:41,777
Miss Qiao,

880
00:42:41,978 --> 00:42:42,898
things are packed.

881
00:42:43,657 --> 00:42:44,097
Let's go.

882
00:42:44,217 --> 00:42:44,617
Okay.

883
00:42:48,097 --> 00:42:48,818
We're adults.

884
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:49,577
Act more mature.

885
00:43:19,378 --> 00:43:20,058
Can you do it?

886
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:22,737
Yan.

887
00:43:23,777 --> 00:43:24,378
Yan.

888
00:43:28,257 --> 00:43:29,338
We know

889
00:43:29,378 --> 00:43:30,538
you're staying at Grandma's.

890
00:43:30,538 --> 00:43:31,617
So we came to check.

891
00:43:34,818 --> 00:43:36,538
Well, where is Haoming

892
00:43:37,177 --> 00:43:37,697
and Haochen?

893
00:43:38,177 --> 00:43:40,177
Haoming took Haochen to do farm work.

894
00:43:40,378 --> 00:43:41,097
Farm work?

895
00:43:41,538 --> 00:43:42,858
Can Haoming and Haochen

896
00:43:43,137 --> 00:43:44,338
handle farm work?

897
00:43:44,858 --> 00:43:46,297
They're guests from afar.

898
00:43:46,338 --> 00:43:47,858
We can't make guests work, right?

899
00:43:47,938 --> 00:43:48,938
I'll talk to Mom.

900
00:43:48,938 --> 00:43:50,378
Grandma's made great arrangements.

901
00:43:51,657 --> 00:43:52,818
They're eating well

902
00:43:52,898 --> 00:43:53,737
and sleeping well.

903
00:43:54,538 --> 00:43:55,938
So you don't need to worry.

904
00:43:58,137 --> 00:44:00,177
Also, I brought Haochen here

905
00:44:00,177 --> 00:44:01,177
to leave him

906
00:44:03,978 --> 00:44:04,978
some peace and quiet.

907
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:06,898
If you want

908
00:44:06,898 --> 00:44:07,978
to see him,

909
00:44:08,858 --> 00:44:10,097
maybe you should come later

910
00:44:10,498 --> 00:44:11,818
when he's in better condition.

911
00:44:11,898 --> 00:44:12,378
Okay?

912
00:44:16,137 --> 00:44:16,458
Okay.

913
00:44:16,498 --> 00:44:18,217
S-Since that's the case,

914
00:44:18,217 --> 00:44:19,097
then we won't

915
00:44:21,137 --> 00:44:22,697
bother you anymore.

916
00:44:22,777 --> 00:44:23,137
I...

917
00:44:24,498 --> 00:44:26,217
Th-These are for your grandma.

918
00:44:26,257 --> 00:44:28,378
These are her calcium tablets

919
00:44:28,378 --> 00:44:29,058
and fish oil.

920
00:44:29,538 --> 00:44:30,858
These are snacks

921
00:44:30,858 --> 00:44:32,177
for Haochen.

922
00:44:32,257 --> 00:44:33,617
Kids love these.

923
00:44:35,697 --> 00:44:36,418
And this...

924
00:44:42,858 --> 00:44:44,177
This is the money

925
00:44:44,938 --> 00:44:46,097
you gave me for treatment.

926
00:44:46,097 --> 00:44:46,818
I didn't use it.

927
00:44:47,338 --> 00:44:49,058
The doctor said the tumor was benign.

928
00:44:49,058 --> 00:44:51,088
After the minimally invasive surgery,
I'm fine now.

929
00:44:52,217 --> 00:44:54,498
We heard what happened
to the Shen family.

930
00:44:56,858 --> 00:44:58,458
Now that you've moved back here,

931
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:02,097
it's convenient for us
to visit from the town.

932
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,938
If you need anything,
be sure to call us.

933
00:45:07,257 --> 00:45:09,058
We can't help much in Jingzhou,

934
00:45:09,418 --> 00:45:10,338
but in our hometown,

935
00:45:10,938 --> 00:45:12,657
we'll definitely find ways to assist,

936
00:45:13,058 --> 00:45:13,538
right?

937
00:45:14,257 --> 00:45:15,257
Take this money.

938
00:45:15,898 --> 00:45:16,858
If it's not enough,

939
00:45:17,737 --> 00:45:18,858
just call us.

940
00:45:19,177 --> 00:45:20,257
We still have savings.

941
00:45:33,257 --> 00:45:33,898
Thank you.

942
00:45:39,898 --> 00:45:41,297
We're family. No need for thanks.

943
00:45:42,777 --> 00:45:43,498
We're leaving now.

944
00:46:13,418 --> 00:46:14,097
You rest first.

945
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:15,344
I'll get your clothes.

946
00:46:16,097 --> 00:46:17,378
When water's hot, take a bath.

947
00:46:21,018 --> 00:46:22,137
It's cold. Drink slowly.
