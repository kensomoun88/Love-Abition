Take a break.

30
00:01:52,093 --> 00:01:53,132
Let's talk about

31
00:01:53,132 --> 00:01:55,212
the makeup and the clothing

32
00:01:55,253 --> 00:01:56,173
for the next episode.

33
00:01:59,052 --> 00:01:59,653
What's wrong?

34
00:02:00,373 --> 00:02:01,492
Why are you down?

35
00:02:02,653 --> 00:02:05,412
We've been spending on fabrics

36
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:06,733
and filming equipment

37
00:02:06,932 --> 00:02:08,132
like water flowing.

38
00:02:08,892 --> 00:02:09,973
Our startup funds

39
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:12,253
are almost gone.

40
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:15,692
I just feel that you trusted me so much,

41
00:02:15,852 --> 00:02:17,012
but the videos we posted

42
00:02:17,412 --> 00:02:18,813
got zero response.

43
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:22,213
I feel terribly guilty.

44
00:02:24,692 --> 00:02:26,132
Snap out of it.

45
00:02:26,132 --> 00:02:27,653
Stop overthinking.

46
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,132
You're our stylist.

47
00:02:29,172 --> 00:02:31,412
Just focus on making good outfits.

48
00:02:31,412 --> 00:02:32,933
Don't worry about anything else.

49
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:34,012
We'll handle them.

50
00:02:34,093 --> 00:02:34,653
Got it?

51
00:02:37,012 --> 00:02:38,053
Then I'll keep trying.

52
00:02:38,773 --> 00:02:40,253
Not a single stitch will be wasted.

53
00:02:41,213 --> 00:02:42,412
You were saying?

54
00:02:43,253 --> 00:02:43,973
Here's the thing.

55
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:45,412
Take a look.

56
00:02:45,852 --> 00:02:47,053
Pick from these.

57
00:02:47,412 --> 00:02:49,093
I also brought many lipsticks

58
00:02:49,692 --> 00:02:51,053
for you to pick.

59
00:02:52,132 --> 00:02:54,132
We'll only expand our consumer base

60
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,452
after building brand awareness.

61
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:58,213
Many college students

62
00:02:58,213 --> 00:02:59,612
and young customers

63
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:01,933
are fond of ethnic-style accessories.

64
00:03:02,172 --> 00:03:02,933
Let's take a look

65
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,292
at our overall design philosophy.

66
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,093
As you can see,

67
00:03:07,093 --> 00:03:08,892
we want ethnic clothing

68
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:10,172
to shine globally

69
00:03:10,172 --> 00:03:11,132
and make an impact.

70
00:03:11,493 --> 00:03:13,933
We've also conducted some research.

71
00:03:14,053 --> 00:03:16,012
Young girl around 20

72
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:17,892
now prefer ethnic outfits,

73
00:03:17,892 --> 00:03:19,412
including Chinese-style clothing.

74
00:03:20,012 --> 00:03:21,172
Mr. Wang, Mr. Zhang, Mr. Li.

75
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,653
We've prepared a presentation.

76
00:03:23,973 --> 00:03:26,012
We target ethnic-style apparel

77
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:27,292
with customized designs.

78
00:03:27,493 --> 00:03:28,933
This is to you. Cheers.

79
00:03:30,572 --> 00:03:31,292
Office workers.

80
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:32,933
This design...

81
00:03:33,452 --> 00:03:35,373
It has modern styling...

82
00:03:39,132 --> 00:03:40,612
It's highly adaptable.

83
00:03:42,612 --> 00:03:44,493
It makes a fashionable daily wear.

84
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:14,933
Hello?

85
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:15,933

86
00:04:17,893 --> 00:04:18,732

87
00:04:18,773 --> 00:04:19,292
Yeah.

88
00:04:19,653 --> 00:04:20,693
Nothing urgent.

89
00:04:20,773 --> 00:04:21,812
I just wanted to

90
00:04:22,213 --> 00:04:24,372

91
00:04:25,372 --> 00:04:27,093
Please review it

92
00:04:27,172 --> 00:04:28,932

93

116
00:05:35,372 --> 00:05:37,013
let's be strangers then.

117
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,653
The screen is broken again.

118
00:05:55,052 --> 00:05:55,732
Shen Haoming.

119
00:05:58,852 --> 00:05:59,653
Why are you here?

120
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,492
I came to check on Yan.

121
00:06:06,732 --> 00:06:07,333
Save it.

122
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:12,252
I feel like
speaking for my sister today.

123
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:15,093
She did make mistakes,

124
00:06:15,133 --> 00:06:17,013
but you're not so innocent, either.

125
00:06:18,292 --> 00:06:19,052
She tried so hard

126
00:06:19,773 --> 00:06:21,252
to save your relationship.

127
00:06:21,252 --> 00:06:22,492
But what did you do?

128
00:06:23,013 --> 00:06:24,693
Now she's running around,

129
00:06:24,693 --> 00:06:25,693
securing investments.

130
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:27,773
If you'd treated her better,

131
00:06:27,773 --> 00:06:29,812
she wouldn't have ended up like this.

132
00:06:30,093 --> 00:06:31,252
Now you're being nice?

133
00:06:31,252 --> 00:06:32,333
That's unnecessary.

134
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:37,693
I want to help her,
but she keeps refusing.

135
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:39,492
Please talk to her.

136
00:06:39,852 --> 00:06:41,372
No, I won't.

137
00:06:43,492 --> 00:06:44,812
She won't take

138
00:06:44,812 --> 00:06:45,932
another penny from you.

139
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:47,973
You should just leave.

140
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,492
And don't come back.

141
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:03,412
Ms. Xu,

142
00:07:03,812 --> 00:07:05,533
the popularity and views of your videos

143
00:07:05,732 --> 00:07:07,932
haven't met our expectations.

144
00:07:08,172 --> 00:07:10,533
We will sit on your proposal for now.

145
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,573
Alright, thank you, Mr. Zhang.
Looking forward to working with you.

146
00:07:13,573 --> 00:07:14,052
Alright.

147
00:07:14,492 --> 00:07:15,773
Same here.

148
00:07:29,893 --> 00:07:30,492
Ms. Xu.

149
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,213
Mr. Jiang Liang.

150
00:07:36,252 --> 00:07:37,093
Call me Mr. Liang.

151
00:07:38,252 --> 00:07:38,773
Mr. Liang.

152
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,336
What a coincidence.

153
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:42,492
I have meetings scheduled here

154
00:07:42,693 --> 00:07:44,013
for some venture projects.

155
00:07:44,852 --> 00:07:46,172
Are you here

156
00:07:46,893 --> 00:07:48,292
for some promising ventures?

157
00:07:49,573 --> 00:07:50,453
Share the information

158
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:51,252
if you don't mind.

159
00:07:51,984 --> 00:07:53,872
(Yan Studio)

160
00:07:54,013 --> 00:07:55,492
I'm seeking funding.

161
00:07:55,932 --> 00:07:56,693
Seeking funding?

162
00:07:58,172 --> 00:07:58,693
You?

163
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:02,612
Yes, me.

164
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:05,052
Ms. Xu, you must be joking.

165
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:06,932
I'm dead serious.

166
00:08:07,812 --> 00:08:08,412
Really.

167
00:08:09,492 --> 00:08:11,052
So the rumors are true.

168
00:08:11,812 --> 00:08:13,773
You and Shen Haoming fell out.

169
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:22,013
That's irrelevant.

170
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:25,773
What's your project about?

171
00:08:38,492 --> 00:08:39,813
Fashion-related short videos.

172
00:08:40,732 --> 00:08:41,852
We aim to expand into

173
00:08:41,852 --> 00:08:43,012
offline garment production.

174
00:08:43,612 --> 00:08:44,252
Short videos?

175
00:08:46,813 --> 00:08:48,492
Why enter such saturated waters?

176
00:08:50,372 --> 00:08:51,093
Mr. Jiang Liang...

177
00:08:51,612 --> 00:08:52,053
Sorry.

178
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,213
Mr. Liang.

179
00:08:54,093 --> 00:08:55,132
Any thoughts?

180
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:59,053
Statistically speaking, I'm pessimistic.

181
00:08:59,693 --> 00:09:01,053
By Q2 this year,

182
00:09:01,413 --> 00:09:02,372
there are 1.55 billion

183
00:09:02,573 --> 00:09:03,492
short video accounts

184
00:09:03,492 --> 00:09:05,213
across major platforms.

185
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:07,652
There are 15.08 million

186
00:09:07,693 --> 00:09:08,973
professional streamers,

187
00:09:09,252 --> 00:09:11,732
500,000 accounts with 100K fans,

188
00:09:12,132 --> 00:09:13,852
40,000 with a million fans,

189
00:09:14,093 --> 00:09:16,693
and just 1,000
with 10 million followers.

190
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:19,612
You want to stand out

191
00:09:19,612 --> 00:09:21,892
in 80 million daily uploads?

192
00:09:21,892 --> 00:09:22,933
All I can say is

193
00:09:24,973 --> 00:09:25,732
good luck.

194
00:09:27,892 --> 00:09:29,093
Impressive, Mr. Liang.

195
00:09:30,372 --> 00:09:32,053
You're very well-informed.

196
00:09:36,652 --> 00:09:38,732
Now, your design is not bad.

197
00:09:39,693 --> 00:09:42,333
It fuses ethnic and avant-garde styles.

198
00:09:43,453 --> 00:09:44,012
But

199
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:46,732
it lacks uniqueness.

200
00:09:47,532 --> 00:09:49,132
The execution is superficial.

201
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,213
It lacks soul.

202
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:51,612
My rule is

203
00:09:52,132 --> 00:09:54,173
better risky than boring.

204
00:09:57,492 --> 00:09:58,213
No offense.

205
00:09:59,173 --> 00:10:00,132
That's just me.

206
00:10:00,772 --> 00:10:01,532
Straight talker.

207
00:10:01,612 --> 00:10:02,333
No offense taken.

208
00:10:03,573 --> 00:10:05,012
Your comment is constructive.

209
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:07,213
I agree.

210
00:10:08,053 --> 00:10:09,492
To get investors,

211
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,693
work on three essentials:

212
00:10:12,532 --> 00:10:13,372
thorough research,

213
00:10:14,173 --> 00:10:15,053
clear strengths,

214
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,492
and absolute execution.

215
00:10:17,293 --> 00:10:18,693
But most people

216
00:10:18,892 --> 00:10:20,693
obsess over the idea alone.

217
00:10:21,532 --> 00:10:22,852
Their approach is wrong.

218
00:10:23,612 --> 00:10:26,252
If we don't emphasize
project-specific context,

219
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,333
what should we address?

220
00:10:29,892 --> 00:10:30,492
The investors.

221
00:10:32,892 --> 00:10:34,053
The investors?

222
00:10:35,492 --> 00:10:36,772
Every investment firm

223
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:38,213
has its own philosophy

224
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:39,372
and key focus areas.

225
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,813
Some value accurate
market understanding,

226
00:10:44,413 --> 00:10:46,492
others emphasize unique selling points,

227
00:10:46,573 --> 00:10:48,693
while some focus on your execution.

228
00:10:49,252 --> 00:10:51,162
Therefore, you must tailor
your proposals

229
00:10:51,162 --> 00:10:53,333
according to the priorities

230
00:10:53,372 --> 00:10:55,093
of each investment firm.

231
00:10:55,892 --> 00:10:59,213
That ensures higher success rates.

232
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:13,612
Thank you.

233
00:11:15,652 --> 00:11:16,933
Don't be discouraged, though.

234
00:11:17,612 --> 00:11:19,012
It's a solid project.

235
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,612
Make proper adjustments.

236
00:11:21,813 --> 00:11:22,852
It will work.

237
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:27,612
Mr. Liang,

238
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,173
from an investor's perspective,

239
00:11:32,973 --> 00:11:34,213
would you fund this project?

240
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:37,492
In its current state,

241
00:11:43,173 --> 00:11:43,772
I wouldn't.

242
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:46,693
But I can bring you

243
00:11:46,693 --> 00:11:47,813
a great photographer

244
00:11:47,813 --> 00:11:48,933
who's my friend.

245
00:11:50,012 --> 00:11:51,492
My connection comes free.

246
00:11:53,492 --> 00:11:54,053
Thank you.

247
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:55,973
No problem. It's nothing.

248
00:11:58,492 --> 00:11:59,173
Let me add you

249
00:12:00,772 --> 00:12:01,492
on WeChat.

250
00:12:02,173 --> 00:12:02,732
Alright.

251
00:12:04,813 --> 00:12:05,648
I'll scan your code.

252
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:07,053
Done.

253
00:12:11,132 --> 00:12:11,933
Mr. Shen,

254
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:14,933
many executives couldn't believe that

255
00:12:15,492 --> 00:12:17,213
the Cheng'an County project
made a comeback.

256
00:12:17,532 --> 00:12:19,492
Hongyun is notorious.

257
00:12:19,892 --> 00:12:22,053
Nobody wants to deal with it.

258
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,252
But this time,

259
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,053
you solved the problems impressively.

260
00:12:26,573 --> 00:12:28,933
This project has been revitalized.

261
00:12:29,213 --> 00:12:30,132
So what?

262
00:12:30,693 --> 00:12:32,732
I'm still sidelined.

263
00:12:32,973 --> 00:12:34,933
Don't you already have a plan?

264
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:38,213
The Baraikins will arrive in Jingzhou

265
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:39,772
for vacation at Yanbo Resort.

266
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:42,093
Golden paint.

267
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:49,612
Jinda's overseas expansion

268
00:12:50,372 --> 00:12:51,813
has long sought cooperation with

269
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,252
this Russian real estate tycoon.

270
00:12:53,892 --> 00:12:55,093
It's a great opportunity.

271
00:12:55,252 --> 00:12:56,132
But someone

272
00:12:56,772 --> 00:12:58,173
might've beaten us to it.

273
00:12:59,892 --> 00:13:00,933
Situo Construction?

274
00:13:02,132 --> 00:13:05,492
They assigned someone named Steve to
speak to the Baraikins.

275
00:13:06,732 --> 00:13:08,492
Let him be the vanguard.

276
00:13:10,492 --> 00:13:11,173
Done.

277
00:13:12,252 --> 00:13:12,852
Chen Lin.

278
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,252
I composed this

279
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:17,973
from 2,441 pieces of agave leaves.

280
00:13:18,093 --> 00:13:18,732
Impressive?

281
00:13:27,053 --> 00:13:27,652
Cool.

282
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:48,892
Thank you.

283
00:13:51,012 --> 00:13:51,813
Mr. Baraikin,

284
00:13:52,252 --> 00:13:55,053
if you're willing to cooperate with us,

285
00:13:55,413 --> 00:13:57,973
you can not only enjoy the investment,

286
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:00,333
our company...

287
00:14:01,293 --> 00:14:01,892
It's okay.

288
00:14:02,372 --> 00:14:03,612
Let's speak Chinese.

289
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,693
Your Chinese proficiency surprises me.

290
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,093
My wife is Chinese.

291
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,053
We speak Chinese at home.

292
00:14:12,973 --> 00:14:13,892
Excellent.

293
00:14:14,173 --> 00:14:15,173
I'll continue in Chinese.

294
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:15,892
Go ahead.

295
00:14:16,252 --> 00:14:17,053
I meant to say

296
00:14:17,372 --> 00:14:18,772
that if you collaborate with us,

297
00:14:19,093 --> 00:14:20,573
we'll increase investment

298
00:14:20,813 --> 00:14:21,732
and prioritize you

299
00:14:22,012 --> 00:14:23,973
as our crucial
overseas strategic partner.

300
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:25,892
I'd consider your proposal.

301
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:28,372
I'll enjoy the vacation

302
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,413
with my wife in China.

303
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:30,813
After that,

304
00:14:31,053 --> 00:14:33,333
I can visit Situo for business.

305
00:14:34,492 --> 00:14:35,173
Excellent.

306
00:14:35,652 --> 00:14:38,333
May I ask about your plans in China?

307
00:14:39,492 --> 00:14:40,532
If you don't mind,

308
00:14:40,892 --> 00:14:41,973
I could be your guide.

309
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:43,372
Thank you.

310
00:14:43,693 --> 00:14:46,453
But our itinerary has already been set.

311
00:14:46,772 --> 00:14:47,693
Besides,

312
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:49,372
I promised my wife

313
00:14:49,372 --> 00:14:50,372
not to talk business

314
00:14:50,732 --> 00:14:51,973
during the vacation.

315
00:14:53,573 --> 00:14:54,892
As you please.

316
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,652
I wish you a pleasant holiday.

317
00:14:59,652 --> 00:15:02,492
I bet you're still single.

318
00:15:03,413 --> 00:15:04,093
Yeah.

319
00:15:04,693 --> 00:15:06,288
Once you get married, you'll realize

320
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,772
that career is just
a small part of life.

321
00:15:09,252 --> 00:15:10,693
A man's achievement is measured

322
00:15:10,732 --> 00:15:12,652
not by wealth nor status,

323
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,492
but by the home he builds.

324
00:15:15,612 --> 00:15:16,093
Here.

325
00:15:17,213 --> 00:15:18,693
To men with families.

326
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:19,612
Thank you.

327
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:22,732
Mr. Baraikin values family deeply.

328
00:15:23,053 --> 00:15:25,492
He believes a man who cherishes

329
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:27,573
and cares for his wife

330
00:15:27,772 --> 00:15:30,173
is truly wise, committed,

331
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:31,852
and a trustworthy partner.

332
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:53,136
(Yan)

333
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,080
(Yan)

334
00:16:20,293 --> 00:16:21,053
Look.

335
00:16:29,813 --> 00:16:30,852
The sleeves are uneven.

336
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:32,573
And here.

337
00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:42,173
Have some coffee.

338
00:16:42,973 --> 00:16:43,732
Thank you.

339
00:16:44,413 --> 00:16:46,492
How do you like
the shooting environment?

340
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,053
It's great.

341
00:16:48,732 --> 00:16:49,973
Thank you for your support.

342
00:16:51,012 --> 00:16:51,573
Mr. Liang,

343
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:52,652
since you're in a hurry,

344
00:16:52,973 --> 00:16:54,173
I've adjusted the order

345
00:16:54,173 --> 00:16:55,213
of the shooting.

346
00:16:55,372 --> 00:16:56,453
Let me brief you.

347
00:16:57,132 --> 00:16:59,852
We plan to start with the second set.

348
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,532
The AC is strong. Don't catch a cold.

349
00:17:02,012 --> 00:17:05,812
I can show you the designs to save time.

350
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:06,772
Right?

351
00:17:07,413 --> 00:17:08,173
Look.

352
00:17:08,413 --> 00:17:11,252
We intend to make this set
our flagship product.

353
00:17:11,693 --> 00:17:12,413
And then...

354
00:17:14,572 --> 00:17:16,213
When a woman becomes unoffendable,

355
00:17:16,292 --> 00:17:18,133
unswayable, and unshakable,

356
00:17:18,893 --> 00:17:21,732
she develops an irresistible charm.

357
00:17:24,373 --> 00:17:24,893
Mr. Liang,

358
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:27,213
your words flow like poetry.

359
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:28,853
Remarkable.

360
00:17:29,012 --> 00:17:30,213
Neither of us is a fool.

361
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,693
I know men like Shen Haoming

362
00:17:32,693 --> 00:17:34,133
born into affluent families.

363
00:17:34,732 --> 00:17:36,052
They never develop

364
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:37,693
genuine emotional attachments.

365
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:39,572
They're shallow

366
00:17:42,213 --> 00:17:43,173
and heartless.

367
00:17:43,373 --> 00:17:44,572
But when you're together,

368
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,893
they make you feel

369
00:17:47,653 --> 00:17:48,653
deeply loved.

370
00:17:50,613 --> 00:17:52,252
You'd better free yourself from him.

371
00:17:52,693 --> 00:17:53,693
I'm willing to help.

372
00:17:53,812 --> 00:17:55,012
And I can be very generous.

373
00:17:55,092 --> 00:17:56,332
Please don't turn me down.

374
00:17:56,453 --> 00:17:56,973
I understand.

375
00:17:57,213 --> 00:17:58,213
I'm glad then.

376
00:17:58,373 --> 00:17:59,252
I'll surely become

377
00:17:59,252 --> 00:18:00,973
your most outstanding partner.

378
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:02,492
I'll work hard.

379
00:18:03,052 --> 00:18:03,693
Trust me.

380
00:18:04,413 --> 00:18:05,133
Qiao Lin.

381
00:18:07,492 --> 00:18:08,532
Qiao Lin, listen.

382
00:18:08,732 --> 00:18:10,292
Set 1 and 3 have the same style.

383
00:18:10,292 --> 00:18:10,893
Charming.

384
00:18:11,213 --> 00:18:11,572
Yeah.

385
00:18:11,653 --> 00:18:12,572
I love it.

386
00:18:13,732 --> 00:18:14,373
Swap them.

387
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:15,532
Okay, then.

388
00:18:15,772 --> 00:18:16,173
It's fine.

389
00:18:16,252 --> 00:18:17,092
Only earrings left.

390
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:17,812
What about Guan?

391
00:18:17,812 --> 00:18:18,373
Same for her.

392
00:18:18,413 --> 00:18:19,492
This'll be quick.

393
00:18:20,853 --> 00:18:22,092
- I need to take this.
- Okay.

394
00:18:25,168 --> 00:18:26,352
(Shen Haoming)

395
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:32,373
What's wrong?

396
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:36,092
I'm busy.

397
00:18:38,332 --> 00:18:39,092
I'm busy.

398
00:18:39,572 --> 00:18:40,413
Okay, go ahead.

399
00:18:47,613 --> 00:18:48,173
Yan.

400
00:18:49,012 --> 00:18:49,613
Who was it?

401
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:52,052
Shen Haoming.

402
00:18:52,693 --> 00:18:53,812
What does he want?

403
00:18:55,973 --> 00:18:56,653
(I need)

404
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:57,893
(your help.)

405
00:18:59,492 --> 00:19:01,092
He needs my help with something.

406
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:03,853
Things are so tense right now.

407
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,092
Would he give you trouble?

408
00:19:10,812 --> 00:19:11,893
You want to see him?

409
00:19:13,092 --> 00:19:14,133
He reached out to me.

410
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:15,653
It must be urgent.

411
00:19:16,413 --> 00:19:17,133
Don't worry.

412
00:19:17,492 --> 00:19:18,893
I'll handle it properly.

413
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,213
Alright.

414
00:19:20,213 --> 00:19:21,173
Go then.

415
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:22,693
You don't listen to anyone.

416
00:19:23,133 --> 00:19:24,012
But remember.

417
00:19:24,173 --> 00:19:25,933
Call me if anything happens.

418
00:19:27,213 --> 00:19:27,812
What for?

419
00:19:28,092 --> 00:19:28,973
I'll beat him up.

420
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:35,492
Always so thoughtful.

421
00:19:36,693 --> 00:19:37,332
Go ahead.

422
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:38,332
Right.

423
00:19:41,572 --> 00:19:42,012
Okay.

424
00:19:43,693 --> 00:19:44,893
Madam, hurry.

425
00:20:08,693 --> 00:20:09,173
Sit.

426
00:20:10,492 --> 00:20:11,532
It's been so long.

427
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:12,492
How are you?

428
00:20:16,572 --> 00:20:17,252
I'm fine.

429
00:20:19,332 --> 00:20:20,373
How's your startup going?

430
00:20:22,613 --> 00:20:23,092
Sit.

431
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:33,732
I'm not here for small talk.

432
00:20:36,213 --> 00:20:37,613
Just get to the point.

433
00:20:40,492 --> 00:20:41,933
I want to discuss a business deal.

434
00:20:43,373 --> 00:20:46,213
I know you're having funding issues.

435
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,052
Consider this a fundraising opportunity.

436
00:20:55,332 --> 00:20:57,052
You're the one in bigger trouble.

437
00:20:58,492 --> 00:20:59,413
You asked me for help.

438
00:21:00,213 --> 00:21:02,613
So don't put on that superior act.

439
00:21:04,492 --> 00:21:05,973
Business requires sincerity.

440
00:21:18,893 --> 00:21:21,492
A Russian couple in real estate

441
00:21:22,693 --> 00:21:23,933
is arriving soon.

442
00:21:25,973 --> 00:21:27,973
I want to collaborate with them

443
00:21:28,492 --> 00:21:30,092
to expand our overseas markets.

444
00:21:31,292 --> 00:21:34,572
But the husband values family greatly.

445
00:21:35,853 --> 00:21:38,572
I hope we can appear in front of them

446
00:21:39,213 --> 00:21:40,492
as spouses.

447
00:21:41,693 --> 00:21:44,492
Help me gain their approval.

448
00:21:46,532 --> 00:21:47,732
Here's their profile.

449
00:21:51,732 --> 00:21:53,453
We're in the cooling-off period.

450
00:21:54,973 --> 00:21:56,693
We're not divorced yet.

451
00:21:57,173 --> 00:21:57,933
Legally,

452
00:21:58,613 --> 00:22:00,292
we're still married.

453
00:22:06,613 --> 00:22:08,213
I won't ask for free help.

454
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:13,173
Feel free to state your terms.

455
00:22:25,296 --> 00:22:27,728
(Green Star Group Company Profile)

456
00:22:29,572 --> 00:22:30,893
How much do you make

457
00:22:32,012 --> 00:22:33,052
for sealing this deal?

458
00:22:34,613 --> 00:22:35,732
At least a billion.

459
00:22:47,693 --> 00:22:48,413
One million yuan.

460
00:22:54,252 --> 00:22:54,973
One million yuan?

461
00:22:55,092 --> 00:22:57,453
My help brings greater returns.

462
00:23:02,373 --> 00:23:03,572
If you refuse,

463
00:23:05,173 --> 00:23:06,173
find someone else.

464
00:23:08,373 --> 00:23:09,492
I meant to say

465
00:23:09,812 --> 00:23:11,052
the apparel industry requires

466
00:23:11,052 --> 00:23:12,012
heavy investment.

467
00:23:12,413 --> 00:23:14,532
A million alone won't make a splash.

468
00:23:16,893 --> 00:23:17,613
Here's the deal.

469
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,973
I'll invest 10 million as a shareholder.

470
00:23:21,532 --> 00:23:23,492
I don't want your investment.

471
00:23:24,213 --> 00:23:25,812
This is an equal partnership.

472
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:27,413
I'll only take my fee.

473
00:23:27,732 --> 00:23:29,812
I don't need anything else.

474
00:23:40,292 --> 00:23:40,772
Okay.

475
00:23:41,973 --> 00:23:42,893
Deal.

476
00:23:43,893 --> 00:23:45,973
One million yuan as your fee.

477
00:23:47,012 --> 00:23:48,413
But remember this.

478
00:23:48,653 --> 00:23:51,252
Mr. Baraikin values
marital bonds deeply.

479
00:23:51,653 --> 00:23:53,252
We need to look like

480
00:23:53,252 --> 00:23:55,012
the most loving couple.

481
00:23:58,332 --> 00:23:59,133
To our partnership.

482
00:24:03,492 --> 00:24:04,292
To our partnership.

483
00:24:31,772 --> 00:24:33,332
The outfit I picked for you look nice.

484
00:24:34,532 --> 00:24:35,213
Hello.

485
00:24:37,772 --> 00:24:38,332
Baby.

486
00:24:38,532 --> 00:24:39,572
Where are our IDs?

487
00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:46,213
Weren't you the one

488
00:24:46,213 --> 00:24:47,492
keeping them all along?

489
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,213
My job is just to enjoy myself.

490
00:24:51,572 --> 00:24:52,292
It's my fault.

491
00:24:52,853 --> 00:24:53,893
I keep forgetting things.

492
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,052
If we can't check in today,

493
00:24:56,292 --> 00:24:58,613
we'll have to camp outside.

494
00:24:58,772 --> 00:25:00,492
Then we'll sleep in a tent,

495
00:25:00,853 --> 00:25:02,213
watch stars and the moon,

496
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:05,332
and have a barbecue.

497
00:25:07,213 --> 00:25:08,252
Sir, your room key.

498
00:25:08,332 --> 00:25:08,933
Thank you.

499
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:10,453
Come on.

500
00:25:10,453 --> 00:25:12,812
This couple seems so in love.

501
00:25:13,492 --> 00:25:14,973
But I don't like Barbie.

502
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:18,893
I prefer Twilight romance.

503
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:27,973
Plan B.

504
00:26:14,252 --> 00:26:15,332
Excuse me.

505
00:26:20,893 --> 00:26:21,933
Excuse me.

506
00:26:28,052 --> 00:26:28,653
Look.

507
00:26:29,012 --> 00:26:30,973
These guys look like Edward and Bella.

508
00:26:31,052 --> 00:26:31,853
Yeah.

509
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:34,532
That's my favorite love story.

510
00:26:34,772 --> 00:26:35,933
You used to watch it a lot.

511
00:26:35,933 --> 00:26:37,572
Yeah, once a week.

512
00:26:42,572 --> 00:26:43,173
Excuse me.

513
00:26:43,613 --> 00:26:44,332
Which floor?

514
00:26:50,973 --> 00:26:51,653
Same.

515
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:02,173
Thank you.

516
00:27:06,012 --> 00:27:06,732
This way, please.

517
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,492
Your room's at the end of this hall.

518
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,252
Please give me a second.

519
00:27:16,893 --> 00:27:18,532
Excuse me, please.

520
00:27:20,413 --> 00:27:21,653
Thank you. This way, please.

521
00:27:28,933 --> 00:27:29,772
Almost there.

522
00:27:35,732 --> 00:27:36,492
Here.

523
00:27:42,693 --> 00:27:44,413
Enjoy your vacation.

524
00:27:51,292 --> 00:27:53,413
May I ask which room you're staying in?

525
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,213
What floor is this?

526
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:57,812
The second floor.

527
00:27:58,812 --> 00:27:59,952
We're on the third floor.

528
00:28:06,693 --> 00:28:07,653
Plan C.

529
00:28:50,572 --> 00:28:51,532
We have a room.

530
00:28:53,653 --> 00:28:54,173
Second floor.

531
00:28:55,572 --> 00:28:57,453
I wish you a pleasant stay.

532
00:28:58,492 --> 00:28:58,933
Please.

533
00:29:05,332 --> 00:29:06,772
Enjoy your stay.

534
00:29:07,492 --> 00:29:08,492
Thank you.

535
00:29:18,693 --> 00:29:19,252
Hello.

536
00:29:19,772 --> 00:29:22,173
Please send the priciest romance package

537
00:29:22,292 --> 00:29:23,492
to Room 2132.

538
00:29:24,092 --> 00:29:25,772
Make sure the cake says

539
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:27,092
"I love you" on it.

540
00:29:27,772 --> 00:29:28,292
Thank you.

541
00:29:58,893 --> 00:29:59,453
Sir, your cake

542
00:29:59,572 --> 00:30:01,453
and champagne are here.

543
00:30:04,373 --> 00:30:06,973
But we didn't order this.

544
00:30:07,532 --> 00:30:07,973
But...

545
00:30:08,133 --> 00:30:10,292
This is Room 2132.

546
00:30:11,292 --> 00:30:12,653
It looks amazing.

547
00:30:12,973 --> 00:30:14,973
Honey, is this a surprise for me?

548
00:30:15,012 --> 00:30:16,252
Thank you, darling.

549
00:30:17,252 --> 00:30:18,092
Stop acting.

550
00:30:18,092 --> 00:30:19,133
I'm so happy.

551
00:30:20,332 --> 00:30:22,572
Please charge it to my room.

552
00:30:22,933 --> 00:30:24,092
Let me bring it inside.

553
00:30:24,092 --> 00:30:24,933
Thank you.

554
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:34,772
He's gone.

555
00:30:55,532 --> 00:30:57,532
This cake is so good.

556
00:30:57,572 --> 00:30:58,973
Thank you, honey.

557
00:31:00,012 --> 00:31:01,732
Have more if you like it.

558
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:03,772
Okay.

559
00:31:04,893 --> 00:31:05,292
Made it.

560
00:31:09,732 --> 00:31:10,252
Hello.

561
00:31:10,532 --> 00:31:11,292
May I help you?

562
00:31:11,973 --> 00:31:13,973
We ordered a romance package

563
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:15,453
and I think the waiter

564
00:31:15,653 --> 00:31:17,012
brought it to your room.

565
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:19,133
Oh, it was yours?

566
00:31:20,413 --> 00:31:21,413
I'm so sorry.

567
00:31:23,973 --> 00:31:25,092
We've already...

568
00:31:27,332 --> 00:31:29,532
I'm sorry, I already took a bite.

569
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:36,613
I'm sorry, I...

570
00:31:36,613 --> 00:31:38,213
- Hello.
- I already took a bite.

571
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:42,732
It's okay.

572
00:31:43,373 --> 00:31:44,492
No need to apologize.

573
00:31:45,853 --> 00:31:47,373
A beautiful cake like this

574
00:31:47,812 --> 00:31:49,453
is meant for a beautiful lady.

575
00:31:49,613 --> 00:31:50,133
Sorry.

576
00:31:50,613 --> 00:31:52,052
My wife seemed delighted.

577
00:31:52,092 --> 00:31:53,012
So we accepted it.

578
00:31:54,252 --> 00:31:54,973
I'm sorry.

579
00:31:55,292 --> 00:31:56,252
Me too.

580
00:31:57,812 --> 00:31:58,933
You are so in love.

581
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,933
You're a great role model
for young couples like us.

582
00:32:04,012 --> 00:32:05,693
We won't disturb you. Let's go.

583
00:32:06,012 --> 00:32:06,693
Wait.

584
00:32:07,332 --> 00:32:09,772
How about the four of us share it?

585
00:32:09,812 --> 00:32:10,893
There's champagne too.

586
00:32:12,572 --> 00:32:13,693
This kind of cake

587
00:32:14,693 --> 00:32:15,893
is only meant for a couple.

588
00:32:16,853 --> 00:32:17,772
How about this, honey?

589
00:32:18,492 --> 00:32:19,213
Tonight,

590
00:32:19,572 --> 00:32:21,092
I'll take you to the hotel lawn.

591
00:32:22,133 --> 00:32:24,853
They're known for their shows.

592
00:32:26,133 --> 00:32:27,373
So romantic.

593
00:32:28,213 --> 00:32:29,492
You're also going to the lawn?

594
00:32:31,133 --> 00:32:33,893
Then let's have a drink later.

595
00:32:34,812 --> 00:32:35,492
- Okay.
- Okay.

596
00:32:36,252 --> 00:32:37,133
- See you tonight.
- See you tonight.

597
00:32:42,332 --> 00:32:43,052
Take the bed.

598
00:32:43,772 --> 00:32:44,532
I'll take the sofa.

599
00:32:44,653 --> 00:32:45,373
Okay, thanks.

600
00:32:56,532 --> 00:32:58,413
That cake was a good idea.

601
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,532
Unpack your own stuff.

Couples in Sync Challenge.

We've prepared

00:34:51,492 --> 00:34:53,652
various games

632
00:34:53,893 --> 00:34:55,853

Let's see if you can
complete the challenges.

00:34:58,572 --> 00:34:59,893

Who wants to go first

637
00:35:05,733 --> 00:35:07,652
and take the challenge?

638
00:35:09,652 --> 00:35:10,492
Excuse me.

639
00:35:10,532 --> 00:35:12,612
Why are you leaving?

640
00:35:12,893 --> 00:35:14,612
Are you scared that you might not

641
00:35:14,773 --> 00:35:15,773
be in sync?

642
00:35:16,492 --> 00:35:17,973
This looks fun. I want to try.

Here.

644
00:35:19,773 --> 00:35:21,413
We have international guests too.

645

Let's welcome them with applause.

646
00:35:28,132 --> 00:35:29,253
Let's try later too.

647
00:35:32,212 --> 00:35:33,933
It's called "Couples in Sync."

648
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:35,293
How are we in sync?

649
00:35:35,853 --> 00:35:37,333
You Act, I Guess.

Ready, go.

651
00:35:38,973 --> 00:35:40,532
Fine, then forget it.

652
00:35:41,253 --> 00:35:42,572
First question.

653
00:35:43,253 --> 00:35:43,973
Two words.

654
00:35:44,656 --> 00:35:46,128
(Sun Wukong)

655
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:47,813
Let's see if you can guess it.

656
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:48,733
(Sun Wukong)
Monkey.

657
00:35:49,652 --> 00:35:50,652
- Sun Wukong.
- Two words.

658
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:52,373
Correct. Congratulations.

659
00:35:52,413 --> 00:35:53,172
Excellent.

660
00:35:53,172 --> 00:35:54,293
Alright, next question.

661
00:35:56,132 --> 00:35:56,532
Nice.

662
00:35:57,293 --> 00:35:58,492
Okay, two words.

663
00:36:01,733 --> 00:36:02,973
Show us your interpretation.

664
00:36:04,052 --> 00:36:05,532
Very vivid.

665
00:36:05,973 --> 00:36:06,692
(Giant Panda)
Two words.

666
00:36:07,052 --> 00:36:07,652
Big bear.

667
00:36:08,813 --> 00:36:09,652
Giant panda.

668
00:36:09,813 --> 00:36:11,492
Correct. Congratulations.

669
00:36:11,612 --> 00:36:12,692
Brilliant.

670
00:36:12,893 --> 00:36:13,773
Our foreign friend

671
00:36:13,773 --> 00:36:15,773

of Chinese culture.

672
00:36:16,012 --> 00:36:17,532

We applaud you.

674
00:36:18,853 --> 00:36:19,373
Excellent.

675
00:36:19,413 --> 00:36:21,012
Okay, next question.

676
00:36:22,092 --> 00:36:23,052
Also two words.

677
00:36:24,733 --> 00:36:25,973
What's happening here?

678
00:36:27,212 --> 00:36:27,813
Okay.

679
00:36:30,172 --> 00:36:30,933
Dancing.

680
00:36:31,532 --> 00:36:32,492
Two words.

681
00:36:33,253 --> 00:36:33,893
Jump.

682
00:36:34,172 --> 00:36:34,733
What...

683
00:36:36,253 --> 00:36:36,973
Swing.

684
00:36:37,492 --> 00:36:38,212
Yangge dancing.

685
00:36:38,492 --> 00:36:40,092
Congratulations, that's correct.

686
00:36:40,612 --> 00:36:41,212
What is this?

00:36:41,212 --> 00:36:42,212
You got everything right.

688
00:36:42,373 --> 00:36:43,092
It's quite windy.

689
00:36:43,092 --> 00:36:43,572
Brilliant.

690
00:36:43,572 --> 00:36:44,853
Next question.

691
00:36:47,532 --> 00:36:48,132
Everyone.

692
00:36:48,492 --> 00:36:49,333
Two words.

693
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,492
Still two words.

694
00:36:51,492 --> 00:36:52,212
There's no wind.

695
00:36:53,492 --> 00:36:55,413
Didn't you agree to cooperate?

696
00:36:56,052 --> 00:36:57,492
Why don't you try to appreciate

697
00:36:57,532 --> 00:36:58,492
your husband?

698
00:36:58,692 --> 00:36:59,973
Tai Chi.

699
00:37:00,413 --> 00:37:03,172
Congratulations again.

700
00:37:03,492 --> 00:37:04,492
A loving couple

701
00:37:04,492 --> 00:37:05,773
wouldn't show off in public.

702
00:37:06,212 --> 00:37:07,492
Don't you understand?

703
00:37:18,012 --> 00:37:18,933
The wife acting up

704
00:37:18,933 --> 00:37:20,132
is a part of the dynamic.

705
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:21,572
Watch your attitude.

706
00:37:24,973 --> 00:37:27,373
You can act up,
but don't cross the line, okay?

707
00:37:30,572 --> 00:37:31,333
Are you upset?

708
00:37:32,893 --> 00:37:34,092
Replace me then.

709
00:37:34,572 --> 00:37:35,532
I'll just quit.

710
00:37:36,413 --> 00:37:38,733
Don't forget we have a contract.

711
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:41,612
It's mutually binding.

712
00:37:42,212 --> 00:37:43,492
I'm not your subordinate.

713
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:46,092
Don't order me around like before.

714
00:37:50,253 --> 00:37:51,933
Congratulations, that's correct.

715
00:37:52,492 --> 00:37:53,492
Amazing.

716
00:37:53,973 --> 00:37:55,373
They're so in sync.

717
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:55,773
Okay.

718
00:37:55,813 --> 00:37:57,933
Let's proceed to the next part.

719
00:37:58,212 --> 00:37:58,933
Bring the towels.

720
00:38:07,933 --> 00:38:09,572
Unentangle the towels.

721
00:38:09,572 --> 00:38:10,893
It's a simple game.

722
00:38:11,092 --> 00:38:12,333
Let's see what happens.

723
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,293
It's impossible to communicate with you.

724
00:38:14,373 --> 00:38:16,132
Then let's stop communicating.

725
00:38:17,492 --> 00:38:18,733
Focus on your task.

726
00:38:18,733 --> 00:38:20,652
Another round of applause for them!

727
00:38:22,172 --> 00:38:24,012
Why do you think we're getting divorced?

728
00:38:24,893 --> 00:38:26,893
If you can't find the right approach,

729
00:38:27,293 --> 00:38:28,492
try different methods.

730
00:38:30,373 --> 00:38:32,052
Try different approaches

731
00:38:32,092 --> 00:38:33,893
to get the towels unentangled.

732
00:38:33,893 --> 00:38:35,212
Because you used me.

733
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:38,692
Didn't you use me?

734
00:38:38,893 --> 00:38:40,253
But I truly love you.

735
00:38:47,212 --> 00:38:48,212
Loved you.

736
00:38:50,773 --> 00:38:51,692
I helped you too.

737
00:38:52,172 --> 00:38:53,492
That means, to you,

738
00:38:53,492 --> 00:38:55,692
our relationship was nothing

739
00:38:55,692 --> 00:38:58,413
but a transaction all along, right?

740
00:38:58,612 --> 00:39:00,773
I don't think we need to
reach this point.

741
00:39:00,773 --> 00:39:01,612
What do you mean?

742
00:39:02,813 --> 00:39:03,612
Want to reconcile?

743
00:39:08,532 --> 00:39:09,612
I've tried.

744
00:39:10,293 --> 00:39:10,973
Did it work?

745
00:39:14,933 --> 00:39:15,692
It's too late.

746
00:39:16,492 --> 00:39:17,612
I just want to tell you

747
00:39:17,692 --> 00:39:19,893
that being with me will benefit you.

748
00:39:20,012 --> 00:39:21,092
Your current business

749
00:39:21,132 --> 00:39:22,293
will waste your money.

750
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:23,532
Only I can save you, okay?

751
00:39:23,532 --> 00:39:24,853
Why do you overestimate yourself?

752
00:39:25,492 --> 00:39:26,973
And why do you belittle me?

753
00:39:28,853 --> 00:39:30,293
You think no one wants to fund me?

754
00:39:30,652 --> 00:39:31,413
Listen carefully.

755
00:39:31,612 --> 00:39:33,652
Investors are lining up.

756
00:39:33,973 --> 00:39:34,813
Want to invest?

757
00:39:35,253 --> 00:39:36,052
Get in line.

758
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:38,352
Who's investing in you?

759
00:39:39,853 --> 00:39:40,492
Tell me.

760
00:39:40,652 --> 00:39:41,532
Stop talking.

761
00:39:42,733 --> 00:39:43,293
Yan.

762
00:39:46,373 --> 00:39:47,652
Look, this is my trophy.

763
00:39:47,933 --> 00:39:48,893
So cute.

764
00:39:48,933 --> 00:39:49,492
Yeah.

765
00:39:49,572 --> 00:39:51,212
Would you like to give it a try?

766
00:39:51,212 --> 00:39:51,612
It's fun.

767
00:39:51,612 --> 00:39:52,172
Us?

768
00:39:52,373 --> 00:39:53,373
It's really fun.

769
00:39:54,853 --> 00:39:55,813
Want to try, honey?

770
00:39:59,092 --> 00:39:59,612
Alright.

771
00:40:00,373 --> 00:40:01,733
The next game is called:

772
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:03,172
"Which Way to Look?

773
00:40:03,253 --> 00:40:04,293
One, Two, Three."

774
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,333
It's another test to see if the couples

775
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:07,373
are in sync.

776
00:40:07,652 --> 00:40:09,853
Please listen to my command.

777
00:40:10,012 --> 00:40:11,012
After I say,

778
00:40:11,253 --> 00:40:13,052
"Which way to look? One, two, three,"

779
00:40:13,132 --> 00:40:14,612
turn your heads.

780
00:40:14,893 --> 00:40:16,933
If you turn in the same direction,

781
00:40:16,973 --> 00:40:17,773
you win.

782
00:40:17,933 --> 00:40:20,813
Otherwise, you will
receive a punishment.

783
00:40:21,132 --> 00:40:21,652
Now,

784
00:40:21,692 --> 00:40:23,092
there's water on the table.

785
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:25,532
Whoever grabs it first

786
00:40:25,813 --> 00:40:27,413
can splash the other.

787
00:40:32,652 --> 00:40:34,012
Who's your investor?

788
00:40:36,293 --> 00:40:37,413
Focus on the game.

789
00:40:42,212 --> 00:40:43,933
Ready, go.

790
00:40:44,293 --> 00:40:45,293
Which way to look?

791
00:40:45,492 --> 00:40:46,052
One.

792
00:40:46,492 --> 00:40:47,253
Two.

793
00:40:47,532 --> 00:40:48,212
Three.

794
00:40:55,212 --> 00:40:56,373
I didn't make the rules.

795
00:40:56,933 --> 00:40:57,692
It's fine.

796
00:40:58,132 --> 00:40:59,092
I understand.

797
00:41:05,692 --> 00:41:06,572
Which way to look?

798
00:41:06,813 --> 00:41:07,492
One.

799
00:41:07,813 --> 00:41:08,532
Two.

800
00:41:08,813 --> 00:41:09,492
Three.

801
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:39,893
We were in sync.

802
00:41:42,092 --> 00:41:42,973
Sorry.

803
00:41:43,933 --> 00:41:44,652
I got confused.

804
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:46,973
It's okay.

805
00:41:48,052 --> 00:41:48,733
I understand.

806
00:41:55,973 --> 00:41:57,253
(Robot)
You Act, I Guess.

807
00:41:57,333 --> 00:41:58,733
Ready, go.

808
00:42:00,572 --> 00:42:01,413
One word.

809
00:42:02,172 --> 00:42:03,253
Watch the details.

810
00:42:04,012 --> 00:42:05,012
What is he doing?

811
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:07,212
Seniors.

812
00:42:08,212 --> 00:42:09,172
Wrong guess.

813
00:42:11,692 --> 00:42:13,413
Try acting differently.

814
00:42:18,012 --> 00:42:18,933
Great dancing.

815
00:42:19,012 --> 00:42:19,933
Poping?

816
00:42:21,733 --> 00:42:22,813
Getting warmer.

817
00:42:26,132 --> 00:42:27,132
Robot.

818
00:42:27,692 --> 00:42:29,413
Correct. Well done.

819
00:42:29,612 --> 00:42:30,253
Excellent.

820
00:42:30,293 --> 00:42:31,492
Next question.

821
00:42:33,373 --> 00:42:34,492
Ready, go.

822
00:42:35,025 --> 00:42:36,112
(Electric fan)

823
00:42:36,813 --> 00:42:37,492
What's this?

824
00:42:40,733 --> 00:42:41,492
Electric fan.

825
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:43,092
You got it.

826
00:42:43,132 --> 00:42:43,813
Fantastic.

827
00:42:43,893 --> 00:42:45,132
You're reading his mind.

828
00:42:45,492 --> 00:42:46,853
Swap positions now.

829
00:42:47,172 --> 00:42:49,413
Let's see how you'll do next.

830
00:42:49,492 --> 00:42:51,132
Everyone, applause please.

831
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:54,773
Thanks. I believe
they will do even better.

832
00:42:55,052 --> 00:42:57,333
(Hide)
Next question. Go.

833
00:43:00,172 --> 00:43:00,692
Four letters.

834
00:43:00,692 --> 00:43:01,572
Okay.

835
00:43:02,733 --> 00:43:03,212
Second one.

836
00:43:04,132 --> 00:43:04,652
Up.

837
00:43:06,492 --> 00:43:07,172
Fourth one.

838
00:43:08,973 --> 00:43:09,532
Down.

839
00:43:10,853 --> 00:43:11,413
Swim.

840
00:43:11,572 --> 00:43:12,172
Swim.

841
00:43:16,773 --> 00:43:17,492
Lookout.

842
00:43:17,813 --> 00:43:18,413
Observation.

843
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:21,212
Next one, please.

844
00:43:21,293 --> 00:43:21,652
(Hide)
Okay.

845
00:43:21,853 --> 00:43:22,773
(Sauerkraut fish)
Next question.

846
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:25,813
Two words.

847
00:43:25,813 --> 00:43:26,333
Two words.

848
00:43:29,293 --> 00:43:32,413
Is she cooking?

849
00:43:35,172 --> 00:43:36,333
Tastes bad.

850
00:43:36,492 --> 00:43:37,853
Final countdown.

851
00:43:38,253 --> 00:43:38,813
Five...

852
00:43:40,212 --> 00:43:40,973
Cut.

853
00:43:41,293 --> 00:43:42,052
Four...

854
00:43:43,572 --> 00:43:44,333
Three...

855
00:43:44,893 --> 00:43:45,373
Two words.

856
00:43:45,692 --> 00:43:46,293
Swim.

857
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:46,933
Swimming.

858
00:43:47,253 --> 00:43:47,652
Two...

859
00:43:47,733 --> 00:43:48,293
Skip, please.

860
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:48,773
Okay.

861
00:43:48,933 --> 00:43:50,333
Alright, next question.

862
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:51,092
(Band-Aid)

863
00:43:51,092 --> 00:43:52,652
Get this one correctly,

864
00:43:52,652 --> 00:43:55,212
and you'll win the game and the prize.

865
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:56,652
(Band-Aid)
Let's see if they can win.

866
00:43:56,692 --> 00:43:57,052
Okay.

867
00:43:57,172 --> 00:43:57,773
Ready,

868
00:43:57,973 --> 00:43:58,492
go.

869
00:44:01,092 --> 00:44:02,532
The nurse removed the needle.

870
00:44:02,893 --> 00:44:04,144
I feared you'd keep bleeding,

871
00:44:04,253 --> 00:44:05,572
so applied a band-aid.

872
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,576
(Band-Aid)

873
00:44:14,692 --> 00:44:15,492
How many characters?

874
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:16,893
If you don't start,

875
00:44:16,973 --> 00:44:18,373
(Band-Aid)
we'll start the countdown.

876
00:44:19,612 --> 00:44:20,172
Okay.

877
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:21,293
Hurry.

878
00:44:21,373 --> 00:44:22,212
We're out of time.

879
00:44:22,733 --> 00:44:23,532
Four.

880
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,212
- Three.
- Come on.

881
00:44:27,813 --> 00:44:28,333
Xu Yan.

882
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:28,893
Two.

883
00:44:32,933 --> 00:44:33,612
Band-Aid.

884
00:44:34,212 --> 00:44:36,012
Congratulations. The answer is correct.

885
00:44:36,012 --> 00:44:36,496
(Band-Aid)

886
00:44:36,612 --> 00:44:38,012
That's incredible.

887
00:44:38,172 --> 00:44:39,572
At the last second,

888
00:44:39,893 --> 00:44:41,692
you actually got it right.

889
00:44:41,773 --> 00:44:42,853
And that gesture

890
00:44:42,893 --> 00:44:44,253
she made was so simple.

891
00:44:45,132 --> 00:44:46,413
They're 100 percent

892
00:44:46,532 --> 00:44:47,413
in sync.

893
00:44:47,472 --> 00:44:48,528
A round of applause.

894
00:44:49,813 --> 00:44:50,773
