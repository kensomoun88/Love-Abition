00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:47,469
Who's next?

197
00:07:47,989 --> 00:07:48,628
Come on.

198
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:50,349
Qiao Lin.

199
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:53,680
♪If you remember me♪

200
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,360
♪Then I'm pleased♪

201
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,672
(Fleeting Time)

202
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:05,109
This...

203
00:08:07,068 --> 00:08:08,268
Drink less.

204
00:08:08,748 --> 00:08:09,989
When you're upset, you'll...

205
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:11,068
get drunk quickly.

206
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:14,268
I'm upset?

207
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,989
I'm happy right now.

208
00:08:19,388 --> 00:08:20,709
Stop pretending.

209
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:22,388
I saw everything.

210
00:08:22,508 --> 00:08:23,628
Yan didn't ask you to stay,

211
00:08:23,868 --> 00:08:24,709
and your face showed

212
00:08:25,748 --> 00:08:26,349
disappointment.

213
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:31,709
Yiming.

214
00:08:33,508 --> 00:08:34,189
Tell me,

215
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:36,268
have I been

216
00:08:36,268 --> 00:08:37,989
sincere enough?

217
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:38,908
Yes.

218
00:08:39,748 --> 00:08:41,589
I've tried everything I have,

219
00:08:42,628 --> 00:08:43,989
and tried everything

220
00:08:43,989 --> 00:08:45,069
to win her back,

221
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:46,949
yet she ignored it.

222
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:53,989
Yiming.

223
00:08:55,908 --> 00:08:57,989
I'm done with her.

224
00:08:58,668 --> 00:08:59,628
Alright, done with her.

225
00:09:01,229 --> 00:09:03,069
I won't call her anymore.

226
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:08,949
If I ever call her again,

227
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:12,469
I'm not a Shen.

228
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:14,429
Stop drinking.

229
00:09:23,268 --> 00:09:23,829
Yan.

230
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:25,229
I had Meng Zhao

231
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:26,868
take Jiang Liang home.

232
00:09:28,349 --> 00:09:28,989
Let's leave.

233
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:31,028
Come on, let's go.

234
00:09:31,628 --> 00:09:32,349
Wait.

235
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,189
One last high note to hit.

236
00:09:39,748 --> 00:09:40,709
Beautiful. Let's go.

237
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:42,589
To where?

238
00:09:43,548 --> 00:09:43,989
Sit down.

239
00:09:44,469 --> 00:09:45,229
Let's drink more.

240
00:09:45,548 --> 00:09:47,748
More? You're already drunk.

241
00:09:48,268 --> 00:09:49,109
I'm not drunk.

242
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:50,349
If you say that,

243
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:51,788
I'll get upset.

244
00:09:52,268 --> 00:09:53,028
I'm not drunk,

245
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:53,949
but happy.

246
00:09:53,989 --> 00:09:54,908
Pure joy.

247
00:09:55,668 --> 00:09:56,508
I think everything

248
00:09:56,508 --> 00:09:57,429
is perfect now.

249
00:09:57,668 --> 00:09:58,548
Drink with me.

250
00:10:00,109 --> 00:10:01,109
Drowning your sorrows,

251
00:10:01,148 --> 00:10:01,548
right?

252
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,109
Alright.

253
00:10:04,748 --> 00:10:06,148
You're upset to let him leave.

254
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,148
Then you should have

255
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:07,868
asked him to stay.

256
00:10:07,868 --> 00:10:09,028
Now, you're upset.

257
00:10:09,229 --> 00:10:10,829
I'm not upset.

258
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:13,268
I'm happy.

259
00:10:13,548 --> 00:10:14,309
Stop pretending.

260
00:10:14,469 --> 00:10:15,309
Think I can't tell?

261
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:16,429
I have you all.

262
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:18,109
You all love me.

263
00:10:19,109 --> 00:10:20,268
And I have Yan Studio.

264
00:10:21,268 --> 00:10:22,788
So many things make me happy.

265
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,309
I don't care if he wants to leave.

266
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:26,829
Don't stay.

267
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:27,868
Just walk.

268
00:10:28,748 --> 00:10:29,309
Don't stay.

269
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:30,388
Would I stay?

270
00:10:30,508 --> 00:10:31,309
I won't either.

271
00:10:31,868 --> 00:10:32,668
It doesn't matter.

272
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:34,309
Who cares?

273
00:10:35,989 --> 00:10:37,069
Who cares if Shen Haoming

274
00:10:37,109 --> 00:10:37,949
loves me.

275
00:10:39,908 --> 00:10:40,589
Stop it.

276
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:41,949
Need a gulp.

277
00:10:58,788 --> 00:11:00,388
Yan, answer the phone.

278
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:02,189
I got signal here.

279
00:11:02,508 --> 00:11:03,189
Yan.

280
00:11:03,548 --> 00:11:04,788
Answer the phone.

281
00:11:04,989 --> 00:11:05,868
Get down here.

282
00:11:06,028 --> 00:11:07,268
You swore you'd never call her.

283
00:11:08,028 --> 00:11:08,589
Listen.

284
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,508
Calling her now

285
00:11:09,548 --> 00:11:10,268
disgusts her more.

286
00:11:12,148 --> 00:11:13,469
I would never disgust Yan.

287
00:11:13,989 --> 00:11:14,908
She loves me,

288
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:16,388
right, Yan?

289
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:18,949
Yan!

290
00:11:19,628 --> 00:11:20,949
Haoming, listen.

291
00:11:20,989 --> 00:11:21,989
You're no Shen anymore.

292
00:11:22,628 --> 00:11:24,069
I don't care. Yan.

293
00:11:24,388 --> 00:11:25,229
I love you.

294
00:11:25,469 --> 00:11:26,748
Answer the phone.

295
00:11:27,508 --> 00:11:28,748
Why did you open the window?

296
00:11:29,668 --> 00:11:31,148
I think someone's calling me.

297
00:11:31,788 --> 00:11:32,628
Who is it?

298
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:33,788
No one's calling you.

299
00:11:33,989 --> 00:11:34,349
Come on.

300
00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:35,268
Someone's calling me.

301
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:36,069
Who is it?

302
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:37,668
Alright.

303
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:42,229
I feel terrible.

304
00:11:43,109 --> 00:11:43,868
I want to go home.

305
00:11:44,229 --> 00:11:45,349
Okay, we're going back.

306
00:11:45,429 --> 00:11:46,268
We'll be there soon.

307
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:49,148
Wait.

308
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:52,069
This isn't my house.

309
00:11:52,788 --> 00:11:53,469
It is.

310
00:11:53,989 --> 00:11:54,829
No, my house

311
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:56,868
is not on this way.

312
00:11:58,388 --> 00:12:00,788
I live at Building 7, 33 East District.

313
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:01,908
Where are we?

314
00:12:02,148 --> 00:12:02,429
Well,

315
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:03,829
we're on the way to your place.

316
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:04,148
This...

317
00:12:04,148 --> 00:12:04,868
No.

318
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:05,908
Turn around.

319
00:12:06,349 --> 00:12:07,229
Where are you going?

320
00:12:07,229 --> 00:12:08,349
Turn around!

321
00:12:09,748 --> 00:12:10,788
Don't be a gate-crasher.

322
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,469
I'm not. That's my house.

323
00:12:12,868 --> 00:12:13,268
Where?

324
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:13,908
I don't know.

325
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:14,829
My house!

326
00:12:15,028 --> 00:12:16,309
Don't you live in Lugang?

327
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:18,349
Kind of.

328
00:12:19,268 --> 00:12:20,788
No. Turn around!

329
00:12:21,268 --> 00:12:22,309
Turn around.

330
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:25,508
Hey...

331
00:12:25,989 --> 00:12:26,908
Think it carefully.

332
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:27,668
Where is it?

333
00:12:28,388 --> 00:12:29,429
Don't be a gate-crasher.

334
00:12:29,508 --> 00:12:29,949
You!

335
00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:30,709
Alright.

336
00:12:30,748 --> 00:12:31,429
Take a rest.

337
00:12:35,868 --> 00:12:36,668
I'm back.

338
00:12:36,868 --> 00:12:37,628
Okay, come back.

339
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:43,069
I'll be back soon.

340
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,069
Jeez!

341
00:12:48,748 --> 00:12:49,829
Wait for me.

342
00:13:33,788 --> 00:13:34,548
Stop it.

343
00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:50,548
Well...

344
00:13:52,109 --> 00:13:53,309
I drank too much last night.

345
00:13:55,949 --> 00:13:56,709
It's okay.

346
00:14:03,069 --> 00:14:04,309
No one knows I'm here,

347
00:14:04,508 --> 00:14:05,028
anyway.

348
00:14:07,548 --> 00:14:08,148
Who is it?

349
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:10,628
Haoming, are you up?

350
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:11,989
It's almost noon.

351
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:12,589
Get up.

352
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,868
Why is he here?

353
00:14:15,709 --> 00:14:16,548
Why are you here?

354
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:17,268
I'm here too.

355
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:19,388
Yan.

356
00:14:19,748 --> 00:14:21,148
You two blacked out last night.

357
00:14:21,548 --> 00:14:22,388
Want to know

358
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:23,668
what happened yesterday?

359
00:14:24,349 --> 00:14:25,148
Get dressed.

360
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:26,148
Come see the video!

361
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:34,189
You go get dressed.

362
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:36,469
It's okay.

363
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:37,709
You first.

364
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:39,028
I won't look.

365
00:14:54,148 --> 00:14:54,829
The quilt.

366
00:14:57,589 --> 00:14:58,268
The quilt.

367
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:02,148
Sorry.

368
00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:03,028
Don't move.

369
00:15:08,748 --> 00:15:09,148
Come.

370
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:10,069
Easy, easy.

371
00:15:10,508 --> 00:15:11,628
Yiming, you're the best.

372
00:15:11,748 --> 00:15:13,429
You're so nice to drink with me.

373
00:15:13,469 --> 00:15:13,989
Okay.

374
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:15,349
You're home.

375
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:16,508
Alright.

376
00:15:17,508 --> 00:15:18,868
Why is this a bar?

377
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:20,148
No, you're home.

378
00:15:20,148 --> 00:15:21,148
This is a bar!

379
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:23,309
Such a beautiful bar!

380
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:24,748
Sit down first.

381
00:15:24,868 --> 00:15:25,268
Sit down.

382
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:26,429
- There's a sofa here.
- Bar.

383
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:32,229
Open the door.

384
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:34,069
Open the door.

385
00:15:35,628 --> 00:15:36,508
Honey!

386
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,148
Honey!

387
00:15:41,748 --> 00:15:42,349
Why here?

388
00:15:43,349 --> 00:15:44,189
Isn't it obvious?

389
00:15:45,508 --> 00:15:46,189
I'm home.

390
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:48,868
I feel like throwing up.

391
00:15:51,548 --> 00:15:53,469
Why did you drink so much?

392
00:15:54,268 --> 00:15:54,748
No.

393
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,268
Why did you drink so much?

394
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,069
Wait, why is there

395
00:15:59,069 --> 00:15:59,949
a stranger?

396
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:00,908
It's so late now.

397
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:02,788
Staying out this late?

398
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:03,628
Get out.

399
00:16:04,829 --> 00:16:05,508
Who are you?

400
00:16:05,788 --> 00:16:07,028
Who are you?

401
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:08,508
Call the police!

402
00:16:08,788 --> 00:16:10,788
This is my bar!

403
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:12,709
This is my bar!

404
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:13,949
Why call the police?

405
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:15,349
This is my house.

406
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:16,628
This is my house.

407
00:16:16,628 --> 00:16:17,189
My house!

408
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:17,989
My house!

409
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:18,709
Mine!

410
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:20,268
Why did you bring her here?

411
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:21,508
- They're fighting now!
- Want a fight?

412
00:16:21,508 --> 00:16:22,349
- Think I wanted this?
- Alright.

413
00:16:22,788 --> 00:16:23,589
She insisted on

414
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:24,388
going here.

415
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:25,109
What could I do?

416
00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:27,388
Stop making things up.

417
00:16:27,628 --> 00:16:28,349
Not that dramatic.

418
00:16:28,349 --> 00:16:29,429
I'm just telling

419
00:16:29,668 --> 00:16:30,429
the truth,

420
00:16:30,668 --> 00:16:31,788
or I'll take your last name.

421
00:16:32,388 --> 00:16:33,628
But you lost your surname.

422
00:16:34,788 --> 00:16:35,309
Well...

423
00:16:36,748 --> 00:16:37,628
That means

424
00:16:37,908 --> 00:16:39,148
you two stayed here

425
00:16:39,229 --> 00:16:40,229
last night, right?

426
00:16:42,189 --> 00:16:43,028
It's because you two

427
00:16:43,429 --> 00:16:44,309
were unpredictable!

428
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:46,668
One second you're enemies...

429
00:16:46,748 --> 00:16:47,508
The next

430
00:16:47,668 --> 00:16:48,709
you were inseparable.

431
00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:50,709
I want to throw up.

432
00:16:51,349 --> 00:16:52,748
Put me down!

433
00:16:53,109 --> 00:16:53,748
I'm warning you,

434
00:16:54,189 --> 00:16:55,028
I'll count to three.

435
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,069
Put me down now!

436
00:16:56,229 --> 00:16:56,748
Go ahead.

437
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:57,668
Three.

438
00:17:02,748 --> 00:17:03,388
Three.

439
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:06,669
Three.

440
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:08,588
Yan! Yan!

441
00:17:08,588 --> 00:17:09,469
Be careful.

442
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:11,389
Be careful.

443
00:17:12,508 --> 00:17:13,149
I'm dizzy.

444
00:17:13,629 --> 00:17:14,268
Honey.

445
00:17:16,588 --> 00:17:17,508
You're so beautiful.

446
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:19,229
Honey, you're so manly.

447
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:22,308
You're finally back.

448
00:17:22,828 --> 00:17:23,548
Did you hear

449
00:17:23,548 --> 00:17:25,308
me calling your name?

450
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:27,429
I knew it was you calling me.

451
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:29,669
Good that you heard.

452
00:17:32,189 --> 00:17:32,909
Let's go.

453
00:17:33,788 --> 00:17:34,308
Wait!

454
00:17:36,469 --> 00:17:37,028
Put me down!

455
00:17:37,588 --> 00:17:38,308
Now!

456
00:17:39,788 --> 00:17:42,068
Who is this?

457
00:17:43,308 --> 00:17:44,709
Where is my wedding photo?

458
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:47,909
Whose back is this?

459
00:17:48,469 --> 00:17:49,909
Don't rush. Wait for me.

460
00:17:56,828 --> 00:17:58,548
This is my back.

461
00:18:00,588 --> 00:18:02,308
No. Don't try to fool me.

462
00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:03,788
This one is slimmer.

463
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:05,028
See?

464
00:18:06,348 --> 00:18:09,068
The shoulders
are much leaner than yours.

465
00:18:09,308 --> 00:18:09,989
Understand?

466
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,068
This was before I built muscle.

467
00:18:13,068 --> 00:18:13,629
This...

468
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:16,348
I am

469
00:18:17,588 --> 00:18:19,229
facing my wife.

470
00:18:20,548 --> 00:18:22,108
Right here.

471
00:18:23,508 --> 00:18:24,949
My wife is so beautiful.

472
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:26,869
Right here.

473
00:18:28,028 --> 00:18:28,669
Honey.

474
00:18:29,268 --> 00:18:29,828
Come.

475
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:34,108
First pan-fry the tuna.

476
00:18:34,508 --> 00:18:35,068
Okay?

477
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:38,268
Golden brown on both sides, okay?

478
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:40,268
Hungry.

479
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:41,788
Should be fine now.

480
00:18:43,548 --> 00:18:45,108
Which one do you want?

481
00:18:47,469 --> 00:18:47,989
This one?

482
00:18:48,788 --> 00:18:49,828
The one that just swam by.

483
00:18:49,949 --> 00:18:50,469
This one?

484
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,949
That one! That one!

485
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:53,828
They aren't sober at all.

486
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:55,949
What if something

487
00:18:55,949 --> 00:18:56,308
happens?

488
00:18:56,709 --> 00:18:58,149
Maybe we should stay.

489
00:18:58,348 --> 00:18:58,949
Makes sense.

490
00:18:59,748 --> 00:19:00,748
I'm afraid they'd really

491
00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:01,629
eat live fish.

492
00:19:02,268 --> 00:19:03,149
I want to eat it.

493
00:19:10,828 --> 00:19:11,508
Don't!

494
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:13,268
Not here.

495
00:19:14,068 --> 00:19:14,869
It's cold here.

496
00:19:14,989 --> 00:19:16,028
- You'll catch cold.
- Don't.

497
00:19:16,108 --> 00:19:16,588
Don't.

498
00:19:16,828 --> 00:19:17,548
Go to the bedroom.

499
00:19:17,629 --> 00:19:18,548
Where's the bedroom?

500
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:19,028
Bedroom!

501
00:19:21,788 --> 00:19:22,709
You know what?

502
00:19:23,348 --> 00:19:24,588
You two were too wild.

503
00:19:25,028 --> 00:19:25,508
Right there,

504
00:19:26,108 --> 00:19:27,989
you kept taking
clothes off and touching.

505
00:19:28,149 --> 00:19:29,108
We were worried you'd

506
00:19:29,189 --> 00:19:30,308
catch cold,

507
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:31,788
so we sent you upstairs.

508
00:19:31,788 --> 00:19:32,828
But you still did wild.

509
00:19:34,949 --> 00:19:35,268
Fine.

510
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:37,028
Then stop.

511
00:19:37,189 --> 00:19:37,548
Right.

512
00:19:37,828 --> 00:19:39,389
I'm getting a break. I'll take her out.

513
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:39,669
Right.

514
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:41,108
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

515
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:42,949
I want to go out too.

516
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:44,989
You? You go with him.

517
00:19:45,028 --> 00:19:45,909
I need to go date.

518
00:19:46,068 --> 00:19:46,748
I'm leaving. Bye.

519
00:19:46,788 --> 00:19:47,588
Let's go.

520
00:19:53,229 --> 00:19:54,629
Shall we...

521
00:19:56,548 --> 00:19:57,588
I need to work today.

522
00:20:00,268 --> 00:20:01,068
Me too.

523
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:08,989
Did I bring my bag yesterday?

524
00:20:11,028 --> 00:20:11,788
I'll look for it.

525
00:20:12,229 --> 00:20:12,748
Thanks.

526
00:20:16,268 --> 00:20:17,429
Can't be here.

527
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,308
I'll look for it.

528
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:24,709
This...

529
00:20:25,149 --> 00:20:25,588
Nothing.

530
00:20:25,748 --> 00:20:26,268
No?

531
00:20:26,748 --> 00:20:27,788
Not here either?

532
00:20:28,068 --> 00:20:28,588
Let me see.

533
00:20:33,788 --> 00:20:34,308
Over there.

534
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:35,508
There.

535
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:38,149
Right.

536
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:45,268
Found it.

537
00:20:46,189 --> 00:20:46,869
Hard to find.

538
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:47,909
Well...

539
00:20:48,629 --> 00:20:49,429
I'm leaving.

540
00:20:52,548 --> 00:20:54,189
Want to grab a meal before that?

541
00:20:57,229 --> 00:20:57,828
Sounds good.

542
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:01,669
What would you like?

543
00:21:02,748 --> 00:21:03,429
Anything is fine.

544
00:21:05,469 --> 00:21:05,989
Like what?

545
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:09,629
Haoming.

546
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,149
I bought you food.

547
00:21:11,348 --> 00:21:12,348
Are you home?

548
00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:25,949
She left.

549
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:33,669
Yes.

550
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:39,548
I am still here.

551
00:21:46,508 --> 00:21:47,548
Morning, Mom.

552
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:49,348
Look.

553
00:21:49,389 --> 00:21:49,909
This is good.

554
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:50,429
Quite sturdy.

555
00:21:51,828 --> 00:21:53,028
We're doing

556
00:21:53,149 --> 00:21:53,709
exercises.

557
00:21:55,508 --> 00:21:56,189
Tricep training.

558
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,149
Very good.

559
00:21:58,788 --> 00:21:59,068
Nice.

560
00:21:59,108 --> 00:21:59,588
Well done.

561
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:00,348
Work?

562
00:22:00,348 --> 00:22:00,869
Great.

563
00:22:01,268 --> 00:22:01,788
Go to work.

564
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:02,189
Work.

565
00:22:02,469 --> 00:22:03,189
Okay, me too.

566
00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:04,909
Pants.

567
00:22:06,949 --> 00:22:07,828
I'm going to work out.

568
00:22:08,588 --> 00:22:09,229
He's so cute.

569
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:10,469
Mom, want to work out?

570
00:22:10,469 --> 00:22:11,068
- Work out.
- Yes.

571
00:22:12,508 --> 00:22:13,548
I bought some breakfast.

572
00:22:13,949 --> 00:22:14,909
How about...

573
00:22:17,108 --> 00:22:17,469
Perfect.

574
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,788
Let me help you, Mom.

575
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,028
I'll help.

576
00:22:31,788 --> 00:22:32,588
Yan, eat this.

577
00:22:33,348 --> 00:22:34,149
I think

578
00:22:34,189 --> 00:22:35,229
it's your favorite.

579
00:22:35,669 --> 00:22:36,389
Have a few more.

580
00:22:40,989 --> 00:22:41,508
Yan.

581
00:22:41,989 --> 00:22:43,696
Congratulations
on winning the competition.

582
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:44,748
Haoming

583
00:22:44,748 --> 00:22:46,108
has been happy for you about this.

584
00:22:47,189 --> 00:22:47,828
Right, Haoming?

585
00:22:49,748 --> 00:22:50,189
Yes.

586
00:22:50,548 --> 00:22:52,308
Actually, Haoming has helped me a lot,

587
00:22:53,308 --> 00:22:54,709
so I should thank him.

588
00:22:58,389 --> 00:22:59,229
There's something

589
00:22:59,229 --> 00:23:00,189
I need your help with.

590
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:04,028
Haochen has advanced
in his equestrian competition.

591
00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:05,229
He wants to hold

592
00:23:05,268 --> 00:23:06,629
a home party.

593
00:23:07,268 --> 00:23:08,748
You know him best.

594
00:23:09,108 --> 00:23:10,028
Could you help me

595
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:10,949
and plan it out?

596
00:23:13,828 --> 00:23:14,508
No problem.

597
00:23:14,989 --> 00:23:15,788
I'll make a plan

598
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:17,108
and send you then.

599
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:17,909
Mom.

600
00:23:17,949 --> 00:23:19,068
Ask Haochen

601
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:20,068
if he has any ideas,

602
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:20,869
okay?

603
00:23:21,469 --> 00:23:22,788
Why don't you just come home

604
00:23:22,788 --> 00:23:23,389
and handle it?

605
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,068
Haochen would be thrilled

606
00:23:25,068 --> 00:23:25,909
to see you back.

607
00:23:26,469 --> 00:23:27,588
So is Haoming.

608
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:28,429
Right?

609
00:23:33,268 --> 00:23:34,669
I'll check my schedule.

610
00:23:36,028 --> 00:23:36,828
It's settled then.

611
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:42,588
This is also your favorite.

612
00:23:44,108 --> 00:23:44,548
Mom.

613
00:23:45,108 --> 00:23:46,669
I really need to go to work

614
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:47,348
today.

615
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:50,389
I haven't even freshened up...

616
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:52,389
For the files.

617
00:23:54,909 --> 00:23:55,869
Well...

618
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:57,028
take your time.

619
00:23:57,429 --> 00:23:58,189
I'm leaving.

620
00:24:00,268 --> 00:24:00,669
Well...

621
00:24:01,828 --> 00:24:03,068
Haoming, see Yan out.

622
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:03,469
No need.

623
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:06,429
Stay here and finish your meal.

624
00:24:06,788 --> 00:24:07,308
Okay.

625
00:24:08,588 --> 00:24:10,149
What? Just go!

626
00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:35,949
Hot?

627
00:24:38,828 --> 00:24:39,429
No.

628
00:24:41,629 --> 00:24:42,508
Need the AC?

629
00:24:43,028 --> 00:24:43,588
No.

630
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:44,108
Okay.

631
00:24:51,788 --> 00:24:53,108
Play some music?

632
00:24:53,989 --> 00:24:54,548
Okay.

633
00:25:18,189 --> 00:25:19,268
Let's turn it off.

634
00:25:27,028 --> 00:25:28,308
My mom's always been like this.

635
00:25:29,268 --> 00:25:30,429
Speaks her mind,

636
00:25:30,828 --> 00:25:31,788
without caring others.

637
00:25:32,268 --> 00:25:32,909
Well,

638
00:25:33,389 --> 00:25:34,189
I think it's nice.

639
00:25:34,828 --> 00:25:35,909
Be open and honest,

640
00:25:37,348 --> 00:25:38,588
never hiding feelings.

641
00:25:55,108 --> 00:25:55,909
- Right, you...
- Right, you...

642
00:25:58,308 --> 00:25:58,989
You first.

643
00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:01,989
How's Yan Studio lately?

644
00:26:04,268 --> 00:26:04,709
Good.

645
00:26:06,588 --> 00:26:08,028
After the competition,

646
00:26:09,108 --> 00:26:10,429
our sales are back to normal.

647
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,348
So our third batch

648
00:26:12,348 --> 00:26:13,508
is being produced now.

649
00:26:15,068 --> 00:26:15,989
Great.

650
00:26:16,629 --> 00:26:17,709
People have

651
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:19,308
high recognition for handmade brocade

652
00:26:19,348 --> 00:26:20,149
right now.

653
00:26:20,588 --> 00:26:21,469
Then what's

654
00:26:21,469 --> 00:26:22,429
your next plan?

655
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:26,588
I want to develop more projects

656
00:26:26,828 --> 00:26:29,229
about traditional dyeing techniques.

657
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:30,949
For example,

658
00:26:31,989 --> 00:26:32,709
Shu brocade.

659
00:26:34,229 --> 00:26:34,828
Heard of it?

660
00:26:38,068 --> 00:26:39,024
Gambiered Canton gauze,

661
00:26:39,949 --> 00:26:40,548
grass cloth.

662
00:26:41,989 --> 00:26:42,669
Moreover,

663
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:45,068
I want to create a new series

664
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:47,389
about botanical dyeing technique.

665
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,508
I think it would be unique.

666
00:26:49,949 --> 00:26:50,629
But this

667
00:26:50,629 --> 00:26:51,828
requires training.

668
00:26:52,588 --> 00:26:53,068
Wonderful.

669
00:26:54,469 --> 00:26:55,909
What did you want to ask me?

670
00:26:57,108 --> 00:26:58,189
I wanted to ask you

671
00:26:58,828 --> 00:27:00,909
if your collaboration with Mr. Baraikin

672
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:01,909
goes well.

673
00:27:03,068 --> 00:27:03,869
Very well.

674
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:04,869
Also,

675
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:06,869
Mrs. Baraikin

676
00:27:07,348 --> 00:27:08,629
is very concerned about you.

677
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:12,429
Right.

678
00:27:14,748 --> 00:27:16,348
I should properly thank her,

679
00:27:16,348 --> 00:27:17,348
but I've been too busy.

680
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:21,788
Are you free tomorrow evening?

681
00:27:25,108 --> 00:27:26,268
I'll invite them for dinner.

682
00:27:29,508 --> 00:27:29,989
Sure.

683
00:27:30,909 --> 00:27:31,588
I'll treat them.

684
00:27:31,869 --> 00:27:32,588
No,

685
00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:33,629
my treat this time.

686
00:27:34,108 --> 00:27:36,108
Tomorrow at 6 PM.
I'll text you the address.

687
00:27:37,469 --> 00:27:37,788
Okay.

688
00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:42,229
I wonder if Mr. Baraikin

689
00:27:42,308 --> 00:27:44,068
prefers domestic or imported liquor.

690
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:46,308
I'll prepare both.

691
00:27:49,508 --> 00:27:50,508
Are we drinking tomorrow?

692
00:27:51,788 --> 00:27:52,429
Of course.

693
00:27:53,189 --> 00:27:53,949
Last time,

694
00:27:53,949 --> 00:27:54,909
he and I didn't enjoy.

695
00:27:55,308 --> 00:27:55,989
Let me tell you,

696
00:27:56,429 --> 00:27:57,548
alcohol is wonderful.

697
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:58,548
After drinking,

698
00:27:58,828 --> 00:28:00,149
it brings us closer

699
00:28:00,629 --> 00:28:01,348
and builds bond.

700
00:28:06,308 --> 00:28:07,788
You shouldn't drink tomorrow.

701
00:28:10,548 --> 00:28:11,429
I can handle it.

702
00:28:21,788 --> 00:28:22,548
Gas it up.

703
00:28:25,108 --> 00:28:26,108
I definitely will.

704
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:33,588
I mean your car.

705
00:28:53,028 --> 00:28:53,869
We've confirmed

706
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:55,028
the details with the factory.

707
00:28:55,268 --> 00:28:56,268
They'll prioritize

708
00:28:56,308 --> 00:28:57,229
producing our line.

709
00:28:57,548 --> 00:28:58,709
The release date

710
00:28:58,748 --> 00:28:59,669
can likely be moved up.

711
00:29:01,588 --> 00:29:02,748
And 30 percent deposit?

712
00:29:03,828 --> 00:29:05,149
The factory manager

713
00:29:05,268 --> 00:29:06,548
has changed attitudes.

714
00:29:06,909 --> 00:29:07,989
Now he's eager to keep us.

715
00:29:08,828 --> 00:29:09,989
The award changed everything.

716
00:29:11,268 --> 00:29:12,068
So,

717
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,108
we need to improve and stay strong.

718
00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:15,989
Once we are stronger,

719
00:29:17,308 --> 00:29:18,629
the world smiles at us.

720
00:29:23,068 --> 00:29:24,469
Monitor the factory closely.

721
00:29:25,108 --> 00:29:25,588
No problem.

722
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:26,909
Let's end here for today.

723
00:29:27,989 --> 00:29:28,588
Head back early

724
00:29:28,828 --> 00:29:29,909
- and get some rest.
- Alright.

725
00:29:30,788 --> 00:29:32,229
I'll review this with you.

726
00:29:33,149 --> 00:29:33,709
Bye.

727
00:29:34,548 --> 00:29:35,429
Are you busy tonight?

728
00:29:36,548 --> 00:29:37,028
Yes.

729
00:29:41,508 --> 00:29:42,028
Hello.

730
00:29:43,788 --> 00:29:44,748
Who's the person

731
00:29:44,748 --> 00:29:45,348
in charge?

732
00:29:46,028 --> 00:29:46,508
Hello.

733
00:29:46,989 --> 00:29:47,669
I'm Xu Yan.

734
00:29:48,189 --> 00:29:49,268
Let me introduce myself.

735
00:29:50,108 --> 00:29:51,308
I'm Zhang Fengyu,

736
00:29:51,629 --> 00:29:53,909
Director of the Economic Service Center
of Gubei Town.

737
00:29:54,189 --> 00:29:55,108
My business card.

738
00:29:55,588 --> 00:29:56,068
Okay.

739
00:29:56,348 --> 00:29:57,548
I heard about you won

740
00:29:57,748 --> 00:29:58,389
the competition

741
00:29:58,709 --> 00:29:59,588
and came to visit.

742
00:30:00,348 --> 00:30:01,469
Here to place orders?

743
00:30:02,788 --> 00:30:03,508
Actually,

744
00:30:04,028 --> 00:30:05,268
I'm not here to purchase.

745
00:30:06,108 --> 00:30:07,108
Let me tell you

746
00:30:07,189 --> 00:30:08,229
the purpose of my visit.

747
00:30:09,469 --> 00:30:10,788
This is Gubei Town's

748
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:12,828
brochure.

749
00:30:12,909 --> 00:30:13,508
(Gubei Town)
Take a look.

750
00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:15,788
This is the leaflet

751
00:30:16,709 --> 00:30:18,229
of our botanical dyeing technique.

752
00:30:18,389 --> 00:30:18,949
Take a look.

753
00:30:23,108 --> 00:30:25,748
Gubei Town specializes
in botanical dyeing,

754
00:30:26,229 --> 00:30:27,548
an intangible cultural heritage.

755
00:30:28,108 --> 00:30:29,629
We know you've helped promote

756
00:30:29,629 --> 00:30:31,268
the handmade brocade.

757
00:30:31,268 --> 00:30:31,909
I wonder

758
00:30:32,268 --> 00:30:33,548
if you could

759
00:30:34,068 --> 00:30:35,909
help promote our botanical dyeing.

760
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:38,588
We are about

761
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:39,508
to develop this series.

762
00:30:42,669 --> 00:30:43,469
I was right to come!

763
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:44,828
Wonderful!

764
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:46,229
To be honest,

765
00:30:46,909 --> 00:30:47,548
for promoting

766
00:30:47,748 --> 00:30:48,909
Gubei Town's tourism,

767
00:30:49,308 --> 00:30:49,828
we plan

768
00:30:50,229 --> 00:30:51,949
to invite influencers

769
00:30:51,989 --> 00:30:52,788
to come for a tour.

770
00:30:53,788 --> 00:30:54,469
We want more

771
00:30:54,469 --> 00:30:55,308
promotional angles.

772
00:30:55,588 --> 00:30:56,028
But

773
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:57,748
I trust you

774
00:30:58,108 --> 00:30:59,629
on promoting the botanical dyeing.

775
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:02,229
Thank you.

776
00:31:02,909 --> 00:31:04,469
Mr. Zhang, thank you

777
00:31:05,068 --> 00:31:06,308
for your trust in Yan Studio.

778
00:31:07,149 --> 00:31:08,588
We're deeply interested in

779
00:31:09,028 --> 00:31:09,989
the botanical dyeing.

780
00:31:11,028 --> 00:31:12,308
We'll contact you later

781
00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:13,389
for the details.

782
00:31:15,308 --> 00:31:16,869
I need to study more

783
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:18,788
about botanical dyeing.

784
00:31:19,028 --> 00:31:19,429
Ms. Xu.

785
00:31:20,028 --> 00:31:21,828
We have botanical dyeing workshops.

786
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:23,149
Just come.

787
00:31:23,389 --> 00:31:24,949
I'll arrange hands-on sessions for you.

788
00:31:25,348 --> 00:31:25,669
Right.

789
00:31:26,308 --> 00:31:27,268
This is Gubei Town's

790
00:31:27,548 --> 00:31:28,308
invitation letter.

791
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:28,909
Here.

792
00:31:28,989 --> 00:31:29,348
Okay.

793
00:31:29,814 --> 00:31:32,816
(Invitation)

794
00:31:33,389 --> 00:31:34,108
Thank you so much.

795
00:31:34,548 --> 00:31:35,588
No, thank you so much.

796
00:31:36,028 --> 00:31:36,788
I'm leaving then.

797
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:38,949
- I'll see you out.
- No need.

798
00:31:38,949 --> 00:31:39,629
Don't bother.

799
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:40,828
See you in town.

800
00:31:42,229 --> 00:31:42,949
- Bye.
- Take care.

801
00:31:44,629 --> 00:31:46,189
Perfect timing.

802
00:31:47,268 --> 00:31:48,469
Things go smoothly.

803
00:31:51,028 --> 00:31:51,389
Right.

804
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:52,989
Sort out all the materials

805
00:31:53,068 --> 00:31:54,229
we collected about

806
00:31:54,469 --> 00:31:55,149
botanical dyeing,

807
00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:56,028
and hold a meeting.

808
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:56,828
Okay.

809
00:32:00,348 --> 00:32:00,828
Ms. Xu.

810
00:32:01,548 --> 00:32:01,949
Let's go.

811
00:32:02,508 --> 00:32:03,108
Where to?

812
00:32:03,429 --> 00:32:05,108
An excellent Yunnan cuisine restaurant.

813
00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:06,189
Let's go try it today.

814
00:32:08,788 --> 00:32:09,588
I have plans.

815
00:32:11,068 --> 00:32:11,588
I'm leaving.

816
00:32:13,709 --> 00:32:14,189
Leaving?

817
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:17,669
Then Ms. Qiao, shall we go?

818
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:18,588
I have plans too.

819
00:32:21,588 --> 00:32:21,949
Wait,

820
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:23,389
only us have no plans?

821
00:32:23,748 --> 00:32:24,669
Apparently.

822
00:32:56,869 --> 00:32:58,149
This place is gorgeous.

823
00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:00,869
Stunning.

824
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:03,669
You're here.

825
00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:05,548
Nice to meet you.

826
00:33:06,149 --> 00:33:06,709
Same here.

827
00:33:06,748 --> 00:33:07,308
Welcome.

828
00:33:07,308 --> 00:33:08,788
Mr. Shen, we meet again.

829
00:33:08,909 --> 00:33:09,268
Hello.

830
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:10,469
Everything's ready.

831
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:11,748
Okay, thanks.

832
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:30,989
Thank you.

833
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:54,348
Hello.

834
00:33:54,748 --> 00:33:56,028
In a hurry to go to the banquet?

835
00:33:56,429 --> 00:33:56,949
Miss Xu.

836
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:10,309
What's the matter,

837
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:10,869
Steve?

838
00:34:13,548 --> 00:34:14,349
I want to give you

839
00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:15,228
a friendly warning.

840
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:16,708
No need,

841
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:17,188
thanks.

842
00:34:18,028 --> 00:34:19,108
Don't you want to know

843
00:34:19,269 --> 00:34:20,309
why Shen Haoming

844
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:21,269
invited you here?

845
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:24,349
Networking?

846
00:34:25,269 --> 00:34:26,269
Or acting with him?

847
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:28,429
Seems like

848
00:34:28,548 --> 00:34:29,869
Shen Haoming

849
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:30,989
has deceived you.

850
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:32,909
Perhaps you don't know

851
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:36,188
Baraikin set a three-month
evaluation period for Jinda Group.

852
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,228
When Yan Studio was in trouble,

853
00:34:38,548 --> 00:34:39,588
he tried everything

854
00:34:39,588 --> 00:34:40,588
to help you.

855
00:34:41,548 --> 00:34:42,548
Have you ever considered

856
00:34:44,108 --> 00:34:45,628
he did all that

857
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,668
merely to keep you

858
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:49,028
from divorce?

859
00:34:50,068 --> 00:34:51,068
Everything he did

860
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:53,148
was just for business,

861
00:34:54,188 --> 00:34:54,909
not out of love.

862
00:34:55,108 --> 00:34:57,068
How long will you stay
in Jingzhou this time?

863
00:34:57,469 --> 00:34:58,108
Actually,

864
00:34:58,108 --> 00:34:59,148
I came with my husband.

865
00:34:59,628 --> 00:35:00,749
He's here to discuss

866
00:35:00,749 --> 00:35:02,188
a collaboration project.

867
00:35:02,429 --> 00:35:02,829
Right,

868
00:35:03,508 --> 00:35:04,228
Haoming's company

869
00:35:04,309 --> 00:35:05,508
is on our shortlist

870
00:35:05,508 --> 00:35:06,429
for the collaboration.

871
00:35:06,548 --> 00:35:07,389
However,

872
00:35:07,389 --> 00:35:08,469
all companies will face

873
00:35:08,508 --> 00:35:09,708
a three-month evaluation.

874
00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:13,188
Then I'll wait

875
00:35:13,188 --> 00:35:13,749
for good news.

876
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:18,789
Shen Haoming said

877
00:35:19,028 --> 00:35:20,228
to love and support his wife

878
00:35:20,548 --> 00:35:21,869
in the interview.

879
00:35:22,228 --> 00:35:23,309
It was genuinely touching.

880
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:25,309
If there were a business world Oscar,

881
00:35:25,588 --> 00:35:26,628
he'd undoubtedly win it.

882
00:35:27,148 --> 00:35:27,469
Right,

883
00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:29,309
after Shen Haoming got interviewed,

884
00:35:29,389 --> 00:35:30,469
Jinda Group's stock

885
00:35:30,469 --> 00:35:31,588
hit the upper limit twice.

886
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:33,068
I think investors

887
00:35:33,668 --> 00:35:34,829
eagerly want to see

888
00:35:34,989 --> 00:35:36,429
a loving couple

889
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:38,789
supporting each other.

890
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:40,429
Mr. Shen has

891
00:35:40,628 --> 00:35:41,588
helped you,

892
00:35:41,829 --> 00:35:42,749
caught the attention

893
00:35:42,749 --> 00:35:43,429
of the Baraikins,

894
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:44,588
and profited

895
00:35:44,628 --> 00:35:45,429
from stock gains.

896
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,269
A triple victory indeed.

897
00:35:48,028 --> 00:35:48,949
So impressed.

898
00:35:49,309 --> 00:35:50,349
As far as I know,

899
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:51,909
today's dinner

900
00:35:52,588 --> 00:35:54,068
aims to convince the Baraikins

901
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,349
that you two

902
00:35:55,469 --> 00:35:56,349
are a loving couple.

903
00:35:59,548 --> 00:36:00,949
He even hired someone

904
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:02,789
to take pictures

905
00:36:02,789 --> 00:36:03,588
of you nearby

906
00:36:04,188 --> 00:36:05,389
and publish romantic snippets.

907
00:36:05,508 --> 00:36:06,389
Giving his all out!

908
00:36:08,108 --> 00:36:09,309
If Shen Haoming

909
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:11,469
secures Baraikin's collaboration,

910
00:36:11,949 --> 00:36:12,869
he'll probably

911
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:13,909
enter the board.

912
00:36:14,188 --> 00:36:15,389
A quadruple victory.

913
00:36:15,949 --> 00:36:16,668
Are you done?

914
00:36:17,548 --> 00:36:18,148
Almost.

915
00:36:19,269 --> 00:36:20,389
I just want to remind you.

916
00:36:20,869 --> 00:36:21,869
In business,

917
00:36:22,909 --> 00:36:24,588
always be cautious.

918
00:37:07,869 --> 00:37:08,548
Mr. Shen,

919
00:37:09,508 --> 00:37:11,588
the three-month evaluation starts now.

920
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:15,028
We hope to partner with Jinda.

921
00:37:16,389 --> 00:37:17,068
Me too.

922
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:19,389
Both Xu Yan and I are thrilled

923
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:21,188
to see you again in China.

924
00:37:22,508 --> 00:37:23,909
How are you two going?

925
00:37:24,949 --> 00:37:25,749
We've reconciled.

926
00:37:26,228 --> 00:37:26,989
She'll arrive soon.

927
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:40,068
Sorry I'm late.

928
00:37:40,989 --> 00:37:41,708
Mr. Baraikin.

929
00:37:42,068 --> 00:37:42,749
Yan.

930
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:44,429
We were just mentioning you.

931
00:37:44,628 --> 00:37:45,429
Long time no see.

932
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:45,989
Darling.

933
00:37:46,188 --> 00:37:47,789
Happy to see you.

934
00:37:48,949 --> 00:37:50,548
I've been overwhelmed

935
00:37:50,548 --> 00:37:51,429
with work lately.

936
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:52,749
I should've visited you.

937
00:37:53,148 --> 00:37:53,749
No worries.

938
00:37:53,989 --> 00:37:55,989
Brought some tea for you
and Mr. Baraikin.

939
00:37:56,228 --> 00:37:56,749
Thank you.

940
00:37:56,789 --> 00:37:57,989
You're so kind.

941
00:37:58,789 --> 00:37:59,588
Let's sit and chat.

942
00:37:59,949 --> 00:38:00,989
I want to sit

943
00:38:01,068 --> 00:38:01,628
with Sophia.

944
00:38:02,148 --> 00:38:03,389
You remembered my real name?

945
00:38:03,588 --> 00:38:04,508
Why can't I remember?

946
00:38:06,068 --> 00:38:07,588
You've lost a lot of weight.

947
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:08,469
Really?

948
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:11,108
Ms. Xu.

949
00:38:12,068 --> 00:38:12,749
I've heard about

950
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:13,989
your company's trouble.

951
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:15,628
Fortunately, you went through.

952
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:16,949
Yes.

953
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,068
Thanks to your wife.

954
00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:20,909
She wore Yan Studio's gown

955
00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:23,389
and gave us such a strong endorsement.

956
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,028
So, we have this success now.

957
00:38:25,228 --> 00:38:25,829
Not really.

958
00:38:25,829 --> 00:38:27,389
Yan Studio's designs are exceptional.

959
00:38:30,068 --> 00:38:31,869
I saw Mr. Shen's interview too.

960
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:33,548
His vision and integrity

961
00:38:33,588 --> 00:38:34,869
truly impress me.

962
00:38:36,789 --> 00:38:39,548
Men like us in business circles

963
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:41,548
may dominate the outside world,

964
00:38:42,309 --> 00:38:43,869
and many cherish their wives.

965
00:38:44,269 --> 00:38:46,349
But to be like Mr. Shen,

966
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,548
who admits his wife outshines him,

967
00:38:49,108 --> 00:38:49,949
that's truly rare.

968
00:38:51,269 --> 00:38:51,749
Thank you.

969
00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:53,588
Indeed.

970
00:38:53,708 --> 00:38:55,068
Back then, Mr. Shen

971
00:38:55,108 --> 00:38:57,228
asked me to choose a gown at Yan Studio.

972
00:38:57,269 --> 00:38:58,108
I knew

973
00:38:58,228 --> 00:38:59,309
he wanted to help you.

974
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:01,309
I told my husband

975
00:39:01,668 --> 00:39:03,708
that they couldn't be in conflict.

976
00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:05,429
If you don't love someone

977
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:06,628
with sincerity,

978
00:39:07,188 --> 00:39:07,949
you can't possibly

979
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:08,949
be so considerate.

980
00:39:11,028 --> 00:39:11,668
I'm flattered.

981
00:39:12,108 --> 00:39:12,989
I should do so.

982
00:39:13,668 --> 00:39:14,148
Yan.

983
00:39:14,749 --> 00:39:15,989
Let's have a toast.

984
00:39:34,148 --> 00:39:35,909
I do need to thank my husband.

985
00:39:37,668 --> 00:39:39,028
He's been secretly

986
00:39:39,068 --> 00:39:40,548
doing a lot of things for me.

987
00:39:41,148 --> 00:39:41,989
And he even

988
00:39:42,028 --> 00:39:42,989
hid some to me.

989
00:39:46,829 --> 00:39:47,548
Haoming.

990
00:39:49,508 --> 00:39:50,228
I toast to you.

991
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:02,349
Honey.

992
00:40:02,668 --> 00:40:04,749
If your collaboration succeeds,

993
00:40:05,148 --> 00:40:06,068
you must invite them

994
00:40:06,108 --> 00:40:07,389
to visit our home in Russia.

995
00:40:07,749 --> 00:40:08,188
Okay?

996
00:40:08,188 --> 00:40:08,668
Sure.

997
00:40:09,548 --> 00:40:10,588
You're welcome to come.

998
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:12,668
He says you're welcome.

999
00:40:13,108 --> 00:40:13,628
Thank you.

1000
00:40:14,869 --> 00:40:15,548
Have some more.

1001
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:16,188
Let's eat.

1002
00:40:21,909 --> 00:40:23,188
Thank you for today.

1003
00:40:23,909 --> 00:40:24,309
Right.

1004
00:40:24,548 --> 00:40:25,148
Don't forget

1005
00:40:25,228 --> 00:40:26,188
to order my gown.

1006
00:40:26,668 --> 00:40:27,508
Don't worry.

1007
00:40:27,588 --> 00:40:29,269
We'll have it custom-tailored.

1008
00:40:29,749 --> 00:40:30,789
But it might take...

1009
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:31,829
Let's meet

1010
00:40:31,949 --> 00:40:32,829
at the conference.

1011
00:40:33,269 --> 00:40:34,228
Looking forward to it.

1012
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:35,309
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1013
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:37,708
Goodbye, Mr. Baraikin.

1014
00:40:37,749 --> 00:40:38,108
Goodbye.

1015
00:40:39,508 --> 00:40:39,869
Okay.

1016
00:40:43,148 --> 00:40:44,028
Goodbye.

1017
00:40:44,349 --> 00:40:44,789
Goodbye.

1018
00:40:46,469 --> 00:40:46,989
Goodbye.

1019
00:40:50,028 --> 00:40:51,148
The wine tonight was good.

1020
00:40:51,269 --> 00:40:51,829
Yes.

1021
00:40:58,148 --> 00:40:58,989
I'm going back.

1022
00:41:00,028 --> 00:41:00,548
Yan.

1023
00:41:00,909 --> 00:41:02,588
I've finished the acting.

1024
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:04,148
Let me explain.

1025
00:41:04,389 --> 00:41:05,148
Mr. Baraikin

1026
00:41:05,148 --> 00:41:06,108
gave Jinda Group

1027
00:41:06,148 --> 00:41:07,429
a three-month evaluation period?

1028
00:41:13,668 --> 00:41:14,869
Don't explain to me.

1029
00:41:17,829 --> 00:41:18,989
You did help me,

1030
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:22,429
but you also achieved

1031
00:41:22,829 --> 00:41:23,668
your own purpose.

1032
00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:28,628
To secure this collaboration,

1033
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:30,789
you skillfully used

1034
00:41:30,829 --> 00:41:32,068
those around you.

1035
00:41:32,749 --> 00:41:33,749
Typical of you.

1036
00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:36,749
You haven't changed.

1037
00:41:39,668 --> 00:41:40,469
But now you can

1038
00:41:40,469 --> 00:41:41,349
finally relax.

1039
00:41:43,148 --> 00:41:43,668
Fine.

1040
00:41:44,708 --> 00:41:45,389
I admit it.

1041
00:41:46,949 --> 00:41:48,349
I had Mrs. Baraikin

1042
00:41:48,389 --> 00:41:49,668
wearing a gown from Yan Studio

1043
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:51,668
and had that interview,

1044
00:41:52,068 --> 00:41:54,269
just to impress Mr. Baraikin.

1045
00:41:54,628 --> 00:41:55,749
But I invited you here

1046
00:41:55,789 --> 00:41:57,028
not to put on an act.

1047
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:00,668
Yet Mr. Baraikin

1048
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:01,429
still saw

1049
00:42:01,508 --> 00:42:03,429
what you wanted him to see, right?

1050
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:04,668
What?

1051
00:42:05,869 --> 00:42:06,749
Do you mean everything

1052
00:42:06,749 --> 00:42:07,508
between us

1053
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:08,588
during this period

1054
00:42:08,588 --> 00:42:09,469
was all fake?

1055
00:42:13,389 --> 00:42:14,068
Doesn't matter.

1056
00:42:18,668 --> 00:42:19,469
What matters is

1057
00:42:19,469 --> 00:42:19,989
if we keep

1058
00:42:19,989 --> 00:42:21,188
arguing like this,

1059
00:42:22,909 --> 00:42:23,909
the paparazzo you hired

1060
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:24,708
might capture

1061
00:42:24,749 --> 00:42:25,588
undesirable photos.

1062
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:35,628
Chen Lin, come here.

1063
00:42:47,429 --> 00:42:47,989
Mr. Shen.

1064
00:42:48,389 --> 00:42:48,909
Yan.

1065
00:42:49,588 --> 00:42:50,349
I've deleted

1066
00:42:50,708 --> 00:42:51,588
all his photos.

1067
00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:53,429
I didn't mean

1068
00:42:53,469 --> 00:42:54,749
to take photos of you.

1069
00:42:55,789 --> 00:42:56,708
Take him away.

1070
00:42:58,989 --> 00:42:59,349
Come on.

1071
00:43:03,469 --> 00:43:04,628
That guy was sneaking around.

1072
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:05,989
I wondered what he was doing.

1073
00:43:09,469 --> 00:43:10,548
Am I that stupid

1074
00:43:11,749 --> 00:43:13,588
to hire such an amateur
for sneak photos?

1075
00:43:14,108 --> 00:43:15,269
Chen Lin is better.

1076
00:43:19,548 --> 00:43:20,148
I understand.

1077
00:43:21,068 --> 00:43:22,668
The collaboration with Mr. Baraikin

1078
00:43:22,749 --> 00:43:24,309
is crucial for Jinda Group.

1079
00:43:25,909 --> 00:43:27,389
But someone's exploiting

1080
00:43:27,429 --> 00:43:28,548
our relationship

1081
00:43:29,508 --> 00:43:30,909
to sabotage your overseas market.

1082
00:43:32,949 --> 00:43:34,309
Someone's targeting me?

1083
00:43:35,148 --> 00:43:35,949
That Steve guy

1084
00:43:38,228 --> 00:43:39,588
has approached me multiple times.

1085
00:43:41,148 --> 00:43:41,749
I know.

1086
00:43:42,349 --> 00:43:43,469
His backing company

1087
00:43:43,469 --> 00:43:44,389
is Situo Company,

1088
00:43:44,749 --> 00:43:46,028
with a shady background.

1089
00:43:47,749 --> 00:43:49,228
He's just their frontman puppet.

1090
00:43:49,228 --> 00:43:50,789
But I don't know

1091
00:43:50,789 --> 00:43:51,909
who's truly behind it.

1092
00:43:57,309 --> 00:43:59,068
That's not my concern,

1093
00:43:59,068 --> 00:43:59,789
but yours.

1094
00:44:01,789 --> 00:44:02,949
I've repaid your favor.

1095
00:44:04,749 --> 00:44:06,068
Wish you go smoothly

1096
00:44:06,068 --> 00:44:06,749
in business.

1097
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:09,068
When did I ever ask you

1098
00:44:09,068 --> 00:44:09,829
to repay my favor?

1099
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:10,789
Am I that kind of man?

1100
00:44:10,789 --> 00:44:11,548
I'd like to know

1101
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:12,869
who exactly you are.

1102
00:44:18,588 --> 00:44:20,188
But I never figured it out.

1103
00:44:24,588 --> 00:44:25,909
Now I finally understand.

1104
00:44:31,829 --> 00:44:32,909
If you want to help me,

1105
00:44:33,789 --> 00:44:35,148
I'll accept it graciously.

1106
00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:38,309
We're adults after all.

1107
00:44:38,708 --> 00:44:40,628
It's quite normal
to go after mutual benefit.

1108
00:44:42,108 --> 00:44:43,469
As for you and I,

1109
00:44:44,429 --> 00:44:46,269
let's just take what we need.

1110
00:44:51,668 --> 00:44:53,068
We can still be friends.

1111
00:44:55,909 --> 00:44:56,389
Take care.
