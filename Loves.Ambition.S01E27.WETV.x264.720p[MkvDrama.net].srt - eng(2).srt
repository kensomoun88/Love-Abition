What's the difference?

39
00:02:15,826 --> 00:02:16,465
Mr. Shen,

40
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,426
I have a suggestion.

41
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,465
We're going to invest
in cultural tourism

42
00:02:21,505 --> 00:02:22,586
in Gubei Town, right?

43
00:02:23,345 --> 00:02:25,026
You take Haochen there every year.

44
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,586
The environment is excellent.

45
00:02:28,225 --> 00:02:28,866
Give yourself

46
00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:30,146
some days off.

47
00:02:32,345 --> 00:02:33,785
I have so much work.

48
00:02:35,986 --> 00:02:37,465
Why not set aside

49
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:39,426
the business for now?

50
00:02:40,185 --> 00:02:41,266
I heard they're

51
00:02:41,426 --> 00:02:43,465
hosting some folk festival there.

52
00:02:44,185 --> 00:02:45,106
There's local food,

53
00:02:45,905 --> 00:02:48,065
local handicrafts,
and botanical dyeing workshops.

54
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:49,185

56
00:02:53,185 --> 00:02:54,465
I'll be on a business trip.

57
00:02:55,106 --> 00:02:56,065
I understand.

58
00:02:57,465 --> 00:02:58,986
We'll get back to you after

59

64
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,106

76
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:27,625
Yan,

77
00:03:28,505 --> 00:03:29,625
take a look and sign this.

78
00:03:35,306 --> 00:03:35,625
Right.

79
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:37,866
Mr. Zhang from Gubei Town called to ask

80
00:03:37,866 --> 00:03:38,785
when you're visiting.

81
00:03:42,266 --> 00:03:43,026
I forgot.

82
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,745
Sorry, I was swamped.

83
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:48,986
No worries.

84
00:03:49,345 --> 00:03:50,386
Take a break.

85
00:03:50,586 --> 00:03:52,065
Consider this field trip

86
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:53,106
a vacation.

87
00:03:53,306 --> 00:03:54,546

88
00:03:54,706 --> 00:03:55,106
Okay?

89
00:03:57,306 --> 00:03:59,106
If everything goes smoothly

90
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:00,826
with this new episode, I'll go.

91
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:02,625

Not today.

190
00:07:07,506 --> 00:07:08,865
I'll learn botanical dyeing.

00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:16,425
Maybe, I can open

197
00:07:16,465 --> 00:07:17,146
a branch store.

198
00:07:17,425 --> 00:07:17,946
You...

199
00:07:18,186 --> 00:07:19,386
Just take over my shop

200
00:07:19,425 --> 00:07:20,345
and be the manager.

201
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:20,865
No way.

202
00:07:21,706 --> 00:07:23,186
Remember that agave-shaped kite

203
00:07:23,186 --> 00:07:23,985
you asked for?

204
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:24,905
Let me fetch it.

205
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:25,865
Okay.

206
00:07:27,105 --> 00:07:28,586
When is the botanical dyeing class

207
00:07:28,626 --> 00:07:29,586
going to start?

208
00:07:29,785 --> 00:07:31,146
I've scheduled it for you.

209
00:07:31,586 --> 00:07:32,545
The workshop is near

210
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:33,425
your accommodations.

211
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:34,105
Check in.

212
00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:35,066
Get settled.

213
00:07:35,146 --> 00:07:35,826
Head there

214
00:07:35,946 --> 00:07:37,305
and study as long as you want.

215
00:07:37,465 --> 00:07:38,026
Thank you.

216
00:07:38,186 --> 00:07:39,280
Our Commercial Street.

217
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:39,746
Okay.

218
00:07:39,905 --> 00:07:40,905
Go ahead.

219
00:07:40,946 --> 00:07:42,266
I've got kites to finish here.

220
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:42,665
Okay.

221
00:07:42,746 --> 00:07:43,600
- Ride safely.
- Bye.

222
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:44,266
This shop

223
00:07:44,586 --> 00:07:45,946
sells unique kites.

224
00:07:46,225 --> 00:07:47,386
They fly high and far.

225
00:07:47,545 --> 00:07:48,186
You think

226
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:48,985
it's gone.

227
00:07:49,105 --> 00:07:49,706
Pull the string

228
00:07:49,905 --> 00:07:50,506
and it's back.

229
00:07:50,746 --> 00:07:51,425
People wonder,

230
00:07:51,626 --> 00:07:52,465
"Is it gone?"

231
00:07:52,826 --> 00:07:54,865
But they can always pull it back.

232
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,706
Everyone loves their kites.

233
00:07:59,665 --> 00:08:00,626
Ms... Ms. Xu.

234
00:08:00,865 --> 00:08:01,506
Ms. Xu.

235
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:03,785
What's wrong?

236
00:08:05,305 --> 00:08:05,746
Nothing.

237
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:07,345
Let's keep going.

238
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:11,266
This is

239
00:08:11,266 --> 00:08:12,545
our best guesthouse.

240
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:14,626
The room you're staying in

241
00:08:15,506 --> 00:08:16,586
is the finest room

242
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:18,066
specifically

243
00:08:18,186 --> 00:08:19,706
reserved for you

244
00:08:19,905 --> 00:08:20,946
by our director.

245
00:08:21,105 --> 00:08:21,826
Thank you, Hua.

246
00:08:22,186 --> 00:08:22,746
Thank you.

247
00:08:22,946 --> 00:08:23,506
No problem.

248
00:08:24,946 --> 00:08:25,386
Right.

249
00:08:25,545 --> 00:08:26,345
Our town

250
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:27,826
isn't exactly small.

251
00:08:28,186 --> 00:08:29,746
We've prepared an electric scooter

252
00:08:30,105 --> 00:08:31,425
for you to roam around.

253
00:08:32,506 --> 00:08:33,065
Ms. Xu.

254
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:35,346
Ms. Xu.

255
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:37,346
Can you ride?

256
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:38,106
Yeah.

257
00:08:38,905 --> 00:08:39,506
I thought you

258
00:08:39,545 --> 00:08:40,266
couldn't ride it.

259
00:08:40,506 --> 00:08:40,746
Well,

260
00:08:40,785 --> 00:08:41,506
rest well.

261
00:08:41,905 --> 00:08:42,506
Call me

262
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:42,986
later.

263
00:08:43,146 --> 00:08:44,746
I'll show you the itinerary.

264
00:08:45,346 --> 00:08:46,545
Thank you, Sir.

265
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:47,386
Thank you.

266
00:08:48,346 --> 00:08:49,065
Get some rest.

267
00:08:49,425 --> 00:08:50,000
- Okay.
- Okay.

268
00:08:51,305 --> 00:08:51,705
Bye.

269
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:52,146
Take care.

270
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:01,785

Throughout the history,

289
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,665
our ancestors developed

290
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,026
vast insights

291
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,146
into colors

292
00:10:08,945 --> 00:10:09,866
and discovered methods

293
00:10:09,945 --> 00:10:10,785
to extract pigments

294
00:10:10,905 --> 00:10:12,185
from nature.

295
00:10:13,386 --> 00:10:14,545
Botanical dyeing

296
00:10:14,785 --> 00:10:17,626
utilizes natural plants
to color textiles,

297
00:10:18,026 --> 00:10:19,506
which is a technique deriving from

298
00:10:20,106 --> 00:10:21,065
and returning

299
00:10:21,425 --> 00:10:22,185
to nature.

300
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,986
"The Exploitation
of the Works of Nature"

301
00:10:24,986 --> 00:10:26,425
recorded over twenty methods

302
00:10:26,506 --> 00:10:28,065
of plant-based dyeing.

303
00:10:28,746 --> 00:10:29,945
In modern terms,

304
00:10:30,106 --> 00:10:30,746
they're natural

305
00:10:31,026 --> 00:10:31,545
and

306
00:10:31,905 --> 00:10:32,496
eco-friendly.

307
00:10:34,305 --> 00:10:35,146
Take a look.

308
00:10:35,986 --> 00:10:38,665
Blue, red, yellow, white, and black.

309
00:10:39,386 --> 00:10:40,266
These are

310
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:40,986
primary colors.

311
00:10:41,585 --> 00:10:42,386
Mixing primaries

312
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:43,705
yields secondary hues,

313
00:10:44,146 --> 00:10:45,266
while mordant treatments,

314
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:46,106
color blending,

315
00:10:46,185 --> 00:10:47,905
and overdyeing techniques...

316
00:10:47,905 --> 00:10:48,665
Excuse me.

317
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:49,305
I'm late.

318
00:10:49,305 --> 00:10:49,866
It's okay.

319
00:10:50,905 --> 00:10:51,825
These methods

320
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,185
yield infinite color variations.

321
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:56,226
Furthermore,

322
00:10:56,466 --> 00:10:57,986
botanical dyeing accommodates

323
00:10:58,065 --> 00:10:59,026
various fabric types.

324
00:10:59,386 --> 00:11:01,305
Silk, cotton, and linen all work.

325
00:11:02,106 --> 00:11:02,866
Do you know

326
00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:04,866
which plants produce

327
00:11:05,346 --> 00:11:06,585
these different colors?

328
00:11:08,305 --> 00:11:09,545
Botanical dyeing transforms

329
00:11:09,545 --> 00:11:10,825
nature's palette

330
00:11:10,905 --> 00:11:12,026
onto textiles.

331
00:11:12,466 --> 00:11:14,065
For greens,

332
00:11:14,386 --> 00:11:16,986
you can use fresh leaves,

333
00:11:17,346 --> 00:11:19,026
sophora buds,

334
00:11:20,705 --> 00:11:21,346
or dye flowers.

335
00:11:21,986 --> 00:11:23,226
Yellow hues

336
00:11:23,346 --> 00:11:24,905
come from turmeric,

337
00:11:25,506 --> 00:11:26,065
mugwort,

338
00:11:26,305 --> 00:11:27,065
or gardenia.

339
00:11:27,506 --> 00:11:29,065
Even common foods and fruits

340
00:11:29,466 --> 00:11:31,106
like blueberries,

341
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:32,705
bayberries,

342
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,185
and red cabbage

343
00:11:34,185 --> 00:11:35,425
can serve as dyes.

344
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:37,425
Well done, Shen.

345
00:11:37,665 --> 00:11:39,226
Your extra classes show.

346
00:11:41,106 --> 00:11:41,905
Today,

347
00:11:42,185 --> 00:11:43,266
we'll practice

348
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:44,746
basic dyeing techniques.

349
00:11:45,386 --> 00:11:46,065
Follow me.

350
00:12:00,425 --> 00:12:01,425
There are some

351
00:12:01,585 --> 00:12:02,506
plain pottery blanks.

352
00:12:03,106 --> 00:12:04,305
Choose one and dye it

353
00:12:04,305 --> 00:12:05,825
with the colors you like.

354
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,545
Very few people know

355
00:12:08,106 --> 00:12:09,146
that our traditional

356
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:10,425
24 solar terms

357
00:12:10,585 --> 00:12:12,026
have corresponding colors.

358
00:12:13,226 --> 00:12:15,346
The Minor Snow solar term in winter

359
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:17,466
starts with crimson-purple and evolves

360
00:12:17,825 --> 00:12:18,866
into pale purple

361
00:12:19,466 --> 00:12:22,746
then transforms into rouge purple.

362
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:24,626
Ms. Qiuzi.

363
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:26,825
I read a book

364
00:12:26,825 --> 00:12:29,226
from the Eastern Jin Dynasty
back in college.

365
00:12:29,305 --> 00:12:30,266
It recorded,

366
00:12:30,665 --> 00:12:31,905
"Upon the Cloud-Reaching"

367
00:12:31,945 --> 00:12:33,266
"Terrace,"

368
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:34,945
"the king's lamps"

369
00:12:35,185 --> 00:12:36,026
"shone for miles,"

370
00:12:37,065 --> 00:12:38,026
"and their smoke"

371
00:12:38,785 --> 00:12:40,065
"was crimson-purple."

372
00:12:40,545 --> 00:12:41,825
I've always wanted to know

373
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:43,026
what kind of purple it is.

374
00:12:43,785 --> 00:12:44,266
So,

375
00:12:44,785 --> 00:12:45,866
may I choose purple?

376
00:12:46,746 --> 00:12:48,185
You're talking about

377
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:50,425
"Record of Heretofore Lost Works"
by Wang Jia,

378
00:12:50,705 --> 00:12:51,986
the earliest documentation

379
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,425
of crape myrtle cultivation.

380
00:12:54,305 --> 00:12:54,705
Alright.

381
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:56,346
Today, let's try

382
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:57,785
to dye fabric

383
00:12:57,905 --> 00:12:58,986
crimson-purple.

384
00:12:59,785 --> 00:13:00,986
Due to limited space,

385
00:13:01,146 --> 00:13:01,785
we'll work

386
00:13:01,825 --> 00:13:02,746
in pairs.

387
00:13:02,905 --> 00:13:03,785
Please pair up.

388
00:13:04,425 --> 00:13:05,266
We'll team up.

389
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:05,712
Okay.

390
00:13:18,146 --> 00:13:18,665

Today we're using

427
00:15:20,065 --> 00:15:21,626
sappanwood for coloring.

428
00:15:21,905 --> 00:15:23,825
Sappanwood has strong dyeing power.

429
00:15:24,305 --> 00:15:26,545
But its natural color is red.

430
00:15:26,945 --> 00:15:28,785
To achieve purple hues,

431
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:31,785
we add alkaline for color fixation.

432
00:15:32,026 --> 00:15:32,665
This way,

433
00:15:32,866 --> 00:15:33,746
we can produce

434
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,106
the unique

435
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:38,185
crimson-purple we envision.

436
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:41,905
Leave the rest

437
00:15:42,386 --> 00:15:43,506
to time.

438
00:15:44,746 --> 00:15:46,905
Whether we succeed
in producing the color

439
00:15:48,026 --> 00:15:49,785
remains uncertain.

440
00:17:22,145 --> 00:17:22,906
What a surprise.

441
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:24,305
You did

442
00:17:24,345 --> 00:17:26,305
a perfect purple dye on the first day.

443
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:28,266
Tomorrow,

444
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:29,746
let's experiment with blue.

445
00:17:30,145 --> 00:17:30,706
Okay.

446
00:17:58,426 --> 00:17:59,266
Shen Haoming.

447
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:04,016
Don't tell me it's a coincidence.

448
00:18:05,825 --> 00:18:06,706
But it is.

449
00:18:07,585 --> 00:18:08,105
What now?

450
00:18:10,825 --> 00:18:11,906
Mr. Baraikin is here?

451
00:18:12,785 --> 00:18:13,666
I've told you

452
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,226
to be open and honest.

453
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:17,625
Don't hide anything

454
00:18:17,986 --> 00:18:19,545
or beat around the bush.

455
00:18:19,706 --> 00:18:20,706
You're busy being

456
00:18:21,825 --> 00:18:22,625
my neighbor

457
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:23,585
and classmate.

458
00:18:24,305 --> 00:18:24,986
What do you want?

459
00:18:25,946 --> 00:18:28,105
I've been here for days.

460
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:30,746
I don't buy it.

461
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,305
I'm not justifying myself.

462
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:34,145
But

463
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:36,105
I have no idea you're here.

464
00:18:36,105 --> 00:18:36,545
Alright?

465
00:18:38,426 --> 00:18:38,946
Whatever.

466
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:39,746
I don't care.

467
00:18:41,466 --> 00:18:42,785
If it bothers you, I'll leave.

468
00:18:50,506 --> 00:18:51,865
Just stay out of my sight.

469
00:19:18,226 --> 00:19:19,145
Hello? What's up?

470
00:19:19,986 --> 00:19:20,986
You've settled in?

471
00:19:21,186 --> 00:19:21,906
How is it?

472
00:19:22,865 --> 00:19:23,426
It's nice.

473
00:19:23,825 --> 00:19:24,785
Beautiful place.

474
00:19:25,506 --> 00:19:26,768
Shen Haoming lives next door.

475
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:29,065
What's going on?

476
00:19:30,906 --> 00:19:32,065
He followed you there?

477
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,946
And he lives next door?

478
00:19:35,026 --> 00:19:35,888
How should I know?

479
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:37,746
What else could he want?

480
00:19:37,785 --> 00:19:38,426
It's so obvious.

481
00:19:38,506 --> 00:19:39,906
He went there for you.

482
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:41,666
My goodness.

483
00:19:42,145 --> 00:19:43,666
He's so persistent.

484
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:46,026
But he's only

485
00:19:46,065 --> 00:19:47,186
perceived as persistent

486
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,585
if he doesn't bother

487
00:19:48,906 --> 00:19:49,706
anyone.

488
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,625
But if you find him annoying,

489
00:19:51,785 --> 00:19:52,506
then he's just

490
00:19:52,865 --> 00:19:54,785
clingy and shameless.

491
00:19:55,105 --> 00:19:55,466
Come on.

492
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,625
It's not that bad.

493
00:19:59,266 --> 00:19:59,986
Feeling sorry?

494
00:20:00,906 --> 00:20:02,666
You can't admit you still care?

495
00:20:03,865 --> 00:20:05,026
Aren't you my sister?

496
00:20:05,506 --> 00:20:06,865
Did you forget his scheme?

497
00:20:07,825 --> 00:20:09,145
I'm your sister and that's why

498
00:20:09,145 --> 00:20:10,426
I need to be fair.

499
00:20:10,706 --> 00:20:11,585
Forget about

500
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,865
his scheme.

501
00:20:13,466 --> 00:20:14,865
He helped Yan Studio,

502
00:20:15,545 --> 00:20:16,865
which also benefits himself.

503
00:20:17,026 --> 00:20:18,865
As CEO of a listed company,

504
00:20:19,105 --> 00:20:20,666
he has a vision, doesn't he?

505
00:20:20,825 --> 00:20:21,986
If he were truly lovesick,

506
00:20:21,986 --> 00:20:22,746
could you stand it?

507
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,426
But he always approaches me

508
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,305
with ulterior motives.

509
00:20:29,506 --> 00:20:30,585
Now, I can't tell

510
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,266
what he wants.

511
00:20:33,545 --> 00:20:35,266
You just won't face your feelings.

512
00:20:36,145 --> 00:20:37,105
Are you still into him?

513
00:20:39,746 --> 00:20:40,186
You won't

514
00:20:40,345 --> 00:20:40,666
answer?

515
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,625
Silence means confirmation.

516
00:20:43,746 --> 00:20:44,105
Yan,

517
00:20:44,145 --> 00:20:46,105
he's not that bad.

518
00:20:46,426 --> 00:20:47,825
You've rejected him so many times,

519
00:20:48,026 --> 00:20:49,026
but he persists.

520
00:20:49,385 --> 00:20:50,145
He'd get anyone

521
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:51,426
he's trying to pursue.

522
00:20:54,305 --> 00:20:55,746
He doesn't pursue anyone.

523
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,706
That's it. I have to go.

524
00:21:05,585 --> 00:21:06,385
Still working?

525
00:21:07,906 --> 00:21:08,986
I still have

526
00:21:08,986 --> 00:21:09,746
some work to do.

527
00:21:10,426 --> 00:21:12,186
You're working too hard.

528
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,186
You should've gone with Xu Yan.

529
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:15,545
Enjoy the nice scenery

530
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:16,825
and take a break.

531
00:21:17,506 --> 00:21:18,865
Get makeup inspirations.

532
00:21:19,785 --> 00:21:21,746
Someone needs to look after the company.

533
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:24,880
Why are you still here?

534
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:27,105
Well,

535
00:21:27,345 --> 00:21:29,625
we need to pay a supplier soon.

536
00:21:30,345 --> 00:21:31,426
I checked the accounts

537
00:21:31,946 --> 00:21:33,506
and our cash flow

538
00:21:33,746 --> 00:21:34,506
is insufficient.

539
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:36,186
Short by how much?

540
00:21:36,746 --> 00:21:37,305
A million.

541
00:21:38,105 --> 00:21:38,946
A million?

542
00:21:43,226 --> 00:21:44,785
We increased factory orders

543
00:21:44,865 --> 00:21:45,986
for urgent production,

544
00:21:46,426 --> 00:21:47,746
so we diverted funds

545
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:49,186
to advance payment

546
00:21:49,186 --> 00:21:50,785
for the factory.

547
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,706
Okay. I'll handle this.

548
00:21:55,585 --> 00:21:57,226
You're managing everything alone.

549
00:21:57,305 --> 00:21:58,186
Take a break.

550
00:21:58,706 --> 00:21:59,466
Let me get you

551
00:21:59,825 --> 00:22:00,545
some dinner.

552
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:01,466
No need.

553
00:22:01,706 --> 00:22:02,585
Braised pork rice.

554
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:03,986
No need, Lin Tao.

555
00:22:05,105 --> 00:22:05,666
Dr. Yu.

556
00:22:08,746 --> 00:22:09,466
Why did you come?

557
00:22:10,305 --> 00:22:10,986
I'm free today,

558
00:22:11,186 --> 00:22:11,865
so I thought

559
00:22:12,026 --> 00:22:12,466
I'd come.

560
00:22:13,585 --> 00:22:14,746
Work can wait.

561
00:22:15,186 --> 00:22:16,105
Now that Dr. Yu's here,

562
00:22:16,506 --> 00:22:17,746
go have dinner.

563
00:22:18,065 --> 00:22:19,026
Rest early.

564
00:22:19,865 --> 00:22:20,466
Well...

565
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:21,986
Guess I'm done for today.

566
00:22:22,226 --> 00:22:22,746
Wait for me.

567
00:22:25,105 --> 00:22:25,545
We're off.

568
00:22:27,065 --> 00:22:28,105
Turn off my PC, please.

569
00:22:28,145 --> 00:22:28,506
Thanks.

570
00:22:28,545 --> 00:22:29,026
Okay.

571
00:22:30,506 --> 00:22:31,345
What are we having?

572
00:22:31,946 --> 00:22:33,026
Hot pot?

573
00:22:33,266 --> 00:22:33,746
Okay.

574
00:22:50,065 --> 00:22:51,906
Bring my makeup bag.

575
00:22:53,946 --> 00:22:54,946
Did you hear me?

576
00:22:56,785 --> 00:22:57,625
Yeah.

577
00:22:57,986 --> 00:22:59,105
Where'd you put it, honey?

578
00:22:59,506 --> 00:23:00,466
In the suitcase.

579
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:01,746
Look properly.

580
00:23:02,226 --> 00:23:03,186
Okay, let me check.

581
00:23:09,385 --> 00:23:09,986
Ms. Xu.

582
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:10,946
Would you like

583
00:23:10,946 --> 00:23:11,785
housekeeping service?

584
00:23:12,986 --> 00:23:13,785
Yes, thank you.

585
00:23:14,466 --> 00:23:15,585
Excuse me.

586
00:23:16,385 --> 00:23:17,906
Where is the guest who stayed here?

587
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:18,986
He has checked out.

588
00:23:28,986 --> 00:23:29,746
He really left?

589
00:23:34,672 --> 00:23:36,026
(Yongshun Botanical Dyeing)
These items

590
00:23:36,026 --> 00:23:37,105
displayed here

591
00:23:37,305 --> 00:23:38,825
are the raw materials for dyeing.

592
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,545
These materials

593
00:23:41,785 --> 00:23:43,226
may look ordinary.

594
00:23:43,825 --> 00:23:44,506
But in reality,

595
00:23:44,706 --> 00:23:45,506
each of them

596
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:47,825
has hidden properties
you wouldn't expect.

597
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:51,426
Xu Yan?

598
00:23:52,186 --> 00:23:52,986
Ms. Qiuzi.

599
00:23:54,105 --> 00:23:55,746
Do you know what this is?

600
00:23:57,906 --> 00:23:58,426
Sorry.

601
00:23:58,426 --> 00:23:59,585
I have no idea.

602
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:02,145
This is called Chinese Indigo.

603
00:24:02,785 --> 00:24:04,545
The common indigo blue we see

604
00:24:04,865 --> 00:24:06,666
is extracted from this plant.

605
00:24:07,105 --> 00:24:07,746
Blue?

606
00:24:08,825 --> 00:24:10,226
This can produce blue dye?

607
00:24:10,506 --> 00:24:11,065
Yeah.

608
00:24:11,585 --> 00:24:12,305
Take a look.

609
00:24:12,345 --> 00:24:13,385
These indigo leaves

610
00:24:13,426 --> 00:24:14,666
need several days of soaking

611
00:24:14,865 --> 00:24:15,986
to release their pigments.

612
00:24:16,426 --> 00:24:17,585
Then we add lime,

613
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:18,865
ferment it, and let it settle

614
00:24:19,345 --> 00:24:21,065
to get the indigo paste.

615
00:24:22,305 --> 00:24:23,065
So today,

616
00:24:23,506 --> 00:24:25,105
we'll try using this indigo paste

617
00:24:25,426 --> 00:24:26,186
to dye blue.

618
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:27,186
Follow me.

619
00:24:39,585 --> 00:24:40,266
Hello, sir.

620
00:24:40,466 --> 00:24:41,305
Feel free to browse.

621
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:46,385
These are all handmade.

622
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:47,785
Do you like it?

623
00:24:48,026 --> 00:24:48,825
Look around.

624
00:24:49,785 --> 00:24:50,266
It's pretty.

625
00:24:50,506 --> 00:24:51,065
Handmade.

626
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:52,026
Okay.

627
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,145
I wanted to ask

628
00:24:55,305 --> 00:24:56,186
if you have

629
00:24:57,426 --> 00:24:59,466
an agave-shaped kite?

630
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,226
That's customized.

631
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:02,946
Do you know the person

632
00:25:02,946 --> 00:25:04,266
who ordered an agave kite?

633
00:25:04,585 --> 00:25:05,666
Haoming.

634
00:25:08,026 --> 00:25:09,266
Shen Haoming from Jinda Group.

635
00:25:09,305 --> 00:25:09,706
Right?

636
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:11,906
We're old acquaintances.

637
00:25:11,906 --> 00:25:13,625
On your way here,

638
00:25:13,706 --> 00:25:14,305
did you notice

639
00:25:14,345 --> 00:25:16,625
the tourist center, the vegetable farm,

640
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:17,426
and our canteen?

641
00:25:17,585 --> 00:25:18,986
Jinda Group built those.

642
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:20,625
It's been years.

643
00:25:25,305 --> 00:25:26,906
So he wasn't pretending?

644
00:25:27,466 --> 00:25:28,026
He was.

645
00:25:30,506 --> 00:25:31,105
He was?

646
00:25:31,506 --> 00:25:32,385
To be a tourist.

647
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:33,746
At first,

648
00:25:33,746 --> 00:25:35,305
we thought he was just a tourist.

649
00:25:35,585 --> 00:25:36,746
But then, the townspeople

650
00:25:37,186 --> 00:25:38,345
said he's from Jinda Group.

651
00:25:38,466 --> 00:25:39,226
Interesting guy.

652
00:25:39,385 --> 00:25:40,986
He came here and said,

653
00:25:41,266 --> 00:25:42,666
"These are handmade, right?"

654
00:25:42,706 --> 00:25:43,466
"Teach me."

655
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:45,785
Skyscraper builders
are different, I tell you.

656
00:25:45,986 --> 00:25:46,585
Fast learner.

657
00:25:47,305 --> 00:25:48,105
The kites he made

658
00:25:48,385 --> 00:25:48,946
all got sold.

659
00:25:49,145 --> 00:25:50,385
He stole all my techniques.

660
00:25:50,706 --> 00:25:51,986
There's nothing else to learn.

661
00:25:52,345 --> 00:25:52,785
And then

662
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:54,065
he went to steal

663
00:25:54,105 --> 00:25:55,145
techniques of

664
00:25:55,385 --> 00:25:56,065
botanical dyeing.

665
00:25:56,105 --> 00:25:56,625
You know?

666
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:01,706
Do you know him?

667
00:26:01,865 --> 00:26:02,746
Are you his friend?

668
00:26:03,466 --> 00:26:04,026
A classmate.

669
00:26:05,785 --> 00:26:07,105
Pick a kite

670
00:26:07,105 --> 00:26:08,105
you like.

671
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:09,026
I like it.

672
00:26:10,706 --> 00:26:11,466
I'll take this one.

673
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:14,946
But I want to customize

674
00:26:16,466 --> 00:26:17,266
an agave one.

675
00:26:19,426 --> 00:26:19,946
Mr. Shen.

676
00:26:20,785 --> 00:26:22,065
I just don't get it.

677
00:26:22,906 --> 00:26:24,065
Did you come to Gubei Town

678
00:26:24,506 --> 00:26:25,746
for Xu Yan

679
00:26:26,145 --> 00:26:27,226
or botanical dyeing?

680
00:26:37,746 --> 00:26:38,545
She said she wanted

681
00:26:39,545 --> 00:26:41,186
to create a botanical dyeing series.

682
00:26:42,785 --> 00:26:44,345
That's why I came

683
00:26:45,305 --> 00:26:47,105
to study this technique for her.

684
00:26:48,625 --> 00:26:50,305
She's still mad at me because of

685
00:26:50,345 --> 00:26:51,226
Mr. Baraikin.

686
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:54,906
I can only

687
00:26:55,545 --> 00:26:56,986
secretly support her.

688
00:26:57,785 --> 00:26:59,026
Love the tree, love the branch.

689
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:00,145
But

690
00:27:00,545 --> 00:27:02,026
since we've run into Yan here,

691
00:27:02,506 --> 00:27:03,585
it's destiny at work.

692
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,625
Why did you move out of the guesthouse

693
00:27:07,266 --> 00:27:08,145
to avoid her?

694
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:10,345
You think I wanted to?

695
00:27:10,865 --> 00:27:11,906
I wouldn't believe

696
00:27:12,385 --> 00:27:14,145
such a coincidence either, okay?

697
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:16,865
She must think

698
00:27:16,865 --> 00:27:17,746
I'm someone

699
00:27:18,266 --> 00:27:19,026
scheming

700
00:27:19,506 --> 00:27:20,266
and clingy.

701
00:27:21,466 --> 00:27:22,186
She even told me

702
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:25,266
not to show up again.

703
00:27:26,746 --> 00:27:27,946
I don't want to upset her,

704
00:27:28,305 --> 00:27:29,186
so I'm staying away.

705
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:33,186
A man like you

706
00:27:33,706 --> 00:27:34,986
is truly our role model.

707
00:27:35,585 --> 00:27:36,585
I have so much to learn.

708
00:27:38,426 --> 00:27:39,266
I almost forgot

709
00:27:39,746 --> 00:27:40,666
about the theater play

710
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:41,785
rehearsal.

711
00:27:42,785 --> 00:27:43,266
Rehearsal?

712
00:27:44,426 --> 00:27:46,065
At least grab a bite first.

713
00:27:46,128 --> 00:27:46,736
(Execution of Chen Shimei)

714
00:27:48,385 --> 00:27:50,746
Casting for The Execution of Chen Shimei

715
00:27:51,026 --> 00:27:52,345
begins now.

716
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:53,466
Bravo!

717
00:28:00,426 --> 00:28:02,986
Wu!

718
00:28:13,145 --> 00:28:14,426
The guesthouse owner said

719
00:28:14,466 --> 00:28:16,706
there's a play rehearsal
at the theater tonight.

720
00:28:17,986 --> 00:28:18,706
Which play?

721
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:20,545
Something about Chen Shimei.

722
00:28:20,785 --> 00:28:22,105
She's playing the princess.

723
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:23,385
Really?

724
00:28:23,585 --> 00:28:24,186
Let's see.

725
00:28:24,785 --> 00:28:26,226
Don't you dare become Chen Shimei.

726
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:27,345
Never.

727
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,666
I'll always support you.

728
00:28:30,226 --> 00:28:31,226
Such a sweet talker.

729
00:28:44,585 --> 00:28:46,145
Chen Shimei.

730
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:49,585
Do you recognize your wife,

731
00:28:49,865 --> 00:28:51,266
Qin Xianglian?

732
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:53,466
Your Honor.

733
00:28:54,426 --> 00:28:56,186
I'm Chen Shimei's

734
00:28:56,266 --> 00:28:57,906
one true wife.

735
00:28:58,585 --> 00:29:01,305
If Qin Xianglian drops the lawsuit,

736
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:05,305
I'll give her 500 taels of silver.

737
00:29:05,545 --> 00:29:07,345
You abused your power

738
00:29:08,345 --> 00:29:09,466
and showed no remorse.

739
00:29:10,105 --> 00:29:11,345
This is outrageous.

740
00:29:11,746 --> 00:29:12,305
Guards.

741
00:29:13,426 --> 00:29:14,226
Execute him.

742
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:15,385
Understood.

743
00:29:18,585 --> 00:29:19,825
Judge Bao, show mercy.

744
00:29:20,226 --> 00:29:21,785
Don't kill my husband.

745
00:29:21,946 --> 00:29:22,706
No.

746
00:29:24,105 --> 00:29:25,105
Your Honor.

747
00:29:26,105 --> 00:29:26,706
Execute him.

748
00:29:27,865 --> 00:29:28,466
Wait.

749
00:29:29,746 --> 00:29:30,906
I mean,

750
00:29:31,105 --> 00:29:32,305
can we revise the script?

751
00:29:33,466 --> 00:29:34,065
What?

752
00:29:34,145 --> 00:29:34,825
Go ahead.

753
00:29:35,466 --> 00:29:36,746
It's a modern adaptation.

754
00:29:37,105 --> 00:29:38,145
Shouldn't it reflect

755
00:29:38,145 --> 00:29:39,305
contemporary values?

756
00:29:40,266 --> 00:29:41,585
In today's context,

757
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:42,865
the protagonist

758
00:29:43,305 --> 00:29:44,666
shouldn't be Chen Shimei.

759
00:29:44,906 --> 00:29:45,986
You mean...?

760
00:29:46,545 --> 00:29:47,825
Focus on the ladies.

761
00:29:48,226 --> 00:29:48,906
Think about it.

762
00:29:49,226 --> 00:29:51,305
Chen Shimei is an ungrateful

763
00:29:51,785 --> 00:29:52,906
social climber.

764
00:29:53,305 --> 00:29:55,105
Why would two women fight over him?

765
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:55,906
Yeah.

766
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:57,906
Brilliant insight.

767
00:29:58,706 --> 00:29:59,865
Mr. Shen, this is genius.

768
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:02,666
He really loves acting.

769
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:04,266
I get your point.

770
00:30:04,266 --> 00:30:04,625
Listen.

771
00:30:04,825 --> 00:30:05,785
See if I'm right.

772
00:30:06,506 --> 00:30:07,585
Qin chased her husband

773
00:30:07,946 --> 00:30:08,746
for a millennium

774
00:30:08,906 --> 00:30:10,506
and arrived at our Gubei Town.

775
00:30:10,946 --> 00:30:12,226
This is destiny.

776
00:30:12,746 --> 00:30:13,865
For such a destiny,

777
00:30:14,105 --> 00:30:15,545
shouldn't we let Qin Xianglian

778
00:30:15,706 --> 00:30:16,385
enjoy her life

779
00:30:16,785 --> 00:30:17,625
and have some fun?

780
00:30:18,785 --> 00:30:19,426
Make the guy

781
00:30:19,706 --> 00:30:20,466
pursue her.

782
00:30:20,825 --> 00:30:23,666
Let Chen Shimei pursue his wife.

783
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:25,506
Something like that.

784
00:30:25,706 --> 00:30:27,226
No wonder I couldn't get immersed.

785
00:30:27,385 --> 00:30:28,385
Yeah, let's do this.

786
00:30:28,746 --> 00:30:29,305
Pursue her?

787
00:30:29,706 --> 00:30:30,426
Genius.

788
00:30:31,785 --> 00:30:33,506
That's what I want to see.

789
00:30:33,906 --> 00:30:36,186
Yeah, good point.

790
00:30:36,385 --> 00:30:37,065
Excellent.

791
00:30:37,065 --> 00:30:37,706
Make up

792
00:30:37,785 --> 00:30:38,706
some lines then.

793
00:30:39,026 --> 00:30:39,426
Right?

794
00:30:39,426 --> 00:30:40,545
We'll follow your lead.

795
00:30:41,186 --> 00:30:41,706
Great idea.

796
00:30:42,865 --> 00:30:43,706
Something came up.

797
00:30:45,186 --> 00:30:45,666
Mr. Shen.

798
00:30:46,065 --> 00:30:46,865
- Come back.
- Where are you going?

799
00:30:47,026 --> 00:30:48,145
But this is

800
00:30:48,345 --> 00:30:48,865
your idea.

801
00:30:48,906 --> 00:30:49,825
Where are you going?

802
00:30:50,466 --> 00:30:50,946
Come back.

803
00:30:50,946 --> 00:30:51,466
Mr. Shen.

804
00:30:52,545 --> 00:30:53,906
Don't go. It's your idea.

805
00:30:54,266 --> 00:30:54,865
Go on.

806
00:30:55,065 --> 00:30:56,545
I don't know how to change

807
00:30:56,585 --> 00:30:57,305
the script.

808
00:30:57,305 --> 00:30:58,105
Chen Shimei.

809
00:30:59,585 --> 00:31:00,625
Why are you shunning me?

810
00:31:01,946 --> 00:31:02,385
I'm not.

811
00:31:04,825 --> 00:31:05,585
Am I scary?

812
00:31:06,946 --> 00:31:07,506
I'm tired.

813
00:31:08,186 --> 00:31:08,946
Tired or guilty?

814
00:31:10,946 --> 00:31:11,946
You said you didn't

815
00:31:12,266 --> 00:31:13,746
want to see me, so I'm trying

816
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:15,426
not to upset you.

817
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:16,906
Why don't you leave?

818
00:31:18,666 --> 00:31:19,746
I came

819
00:31:20,065 --> 00:31:21,385
to learn botanical dyeing.

820
00:31:22,785 --> 00:31:24,145
What for?

821
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:28,706
I want to share some common topics

822
00:31:29,466 --> 00:31:30,946

I mean it.

826
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:41,666
You said you want to learn

00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:42,585
botanical dyeing.

828
00:31:43,545 --> 00:31:44,506
So I wanted

829
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:45,865
to study it first.

830
00:31:46,746 --> 00:31:48,706
Maybe it becomes our common interest.

831
00:31:52,226 --> 00:31:52,706
Besides,

832
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:54,345
regarding the question you asked,

833
00:31:55,385 --> 00:31:57,266

People in our town

846
00:32:40,466 --> 00:32:42,585
have practiced ancient dyeing techniques

847
00:32:42,906 --> 00:32:44,746
for over a century.

848
00:32:45,385 --> 00:32:46,426
The exhibits here

849
00:32:46,666 --> 00:32:47,746
showcase works

850
00:32:47,986 --> 00:32:49,906
by our master artisans.

851
00:32:51,145 --> 00:32:52,746
You've learned the theory

852
00:32:52,785 --> 00:32:53,865
and basic practice.

853
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:55,226
Here,

854
00:32:55,426 --> 00:32:57,226
you'll feel the charm

855
00:32:57,545 --> 00:32:58,706
of botanical dyeing.

856
00:32:59,585 --> 00:33:00,065
Look.

857
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:01,946
(Zhaxie)
This is Zhaxie,

858
00:33:02,585 --> 00:33:04,105
commonly called tie-dye.

859
00:33:05,186 --> 00:33:06,706
Botanical dyeing

860
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:09,145
is a fusion of nature and time.

861
00:33:10,065 --> 00:33:10,785
It's calming

862
00:33:11,506 --> 00:33:12,186
and soothing.

863
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:17,026
Ahead is Jiaxie.

864
00:33:18,426 --> 00:33:19,065
Jiexie.

865
00:33:19,065 --> 00:33:20,528
(Jiaxie)

866
00:33:21,305 --> 00:33:21,825
This

867
00:33:22,666 --> 00:33:23,906
carries a rustic vibe.

868
00:33:24,706 --> 00:33:25,906
The blue hue is powerful.

869
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:29,226
(Laxie)
Over here is Laxie,

870
00:33:29,785 --> 00:33:31,145
also known as

871
00:33:31,585 --> 00:33:32,785
traditional batik.

872
00:33:33,226 --> 00:33:33,825
(Laxie)
Look.

873
00:33:34,385 --> 00:33:35,145
You have to

874
00:33:35,345 --> 00:33:36,825
draw the lines

875
00:33:36,906 --> 00:33:38,385
with beeswax

876
00:33:38,746 --> 00:33:39,785
before dyeing.

877
00:33:41,226 --> 00:33:42,585
But modern industry

878
00:33:43,026 --> 00:33:44,105
uses machines

879
00:33:44,305 --> 00:33:45,506
to replicate

880
00:33:45,506 --> 00:33:47,065
handmade effects

881
00:33:47,305 --> 00:33:48,305
at a lower cost.

882
00:33:49,145 --> 00:33:51,186
Craftsmen who insist
on the manual approach

883
00:33:51,345 --> 00:33:52,506
are dwindling.

884
00:33:53,746 --> 00:33:54,986
Excuse me, Ms. Qiuzi.

885
00:33:56,145 --> 00:33:57,906
Is there no original piece of this?

886
00:33:57,946 --> 00:33:59,065
Why is it a photo?

887
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:00,906
This is

888
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:01,946
the work of

889
00:34:01,986 --> 00:34:03,145
a local veteran craftsman.

890
00:34:03,466 --> 00:34:04,706
We're displaying the photos

891
00:34:04,906 --> 00:34:06,305
because we can't get the original.

892
00:34:06,506 --> 00:34:07,426
A local craftsman?

893
00:34:07,706 --> 00:34:08,105
Yeah.

894
00:34:09,346 --> 00:34:11,306
A local artisan created these patterns

895
00:34:11,306 --> 00:34:12,426
peculiar to Southwestern

896
00:34:14,065 --> 00:34:15,265
ethnic minority groups.

897
00:34:15,466 --> 00:34:16,466
This master craftsman

898
00:34:16,585 --> 00:34:18,906
once lived in Miao ethnic villages.

899
00:34:19,386 --> 00:34:19,946
Therefore,

900
00:34:20,145 --> 00:34:21,306
he brought back

901
00:34:21,306 --> 00:34:22,105
their techniques.

902
00:34:22,906 --> 00:34:23,466
Look.

903
00:34:23,665 --> 00:34:24,986
His style leans heavily

904
00:34:25,026 --> 00:34:26,105
towards traditional

905
00:34:26,145 --> 00:34:27,065
folk patterns.

906
00:34:27,786 --> 00:34:29,506
Our designer at Yan Studio

907
00:34:29,585 --> 00:34:31,585
happens to be from the Yi ethnic group.

908
00:34:32,585 --> 00:34:33,466
If she saw

909
00:34:33,506 --> 00:34:34,466
such a design,

910
00:34:35,026 --> 00:34:35,946
she'd be thrilled.

911
00:34:37,105 --> 00:34:37,705
Ms. Qiuzi,

912
00:34:38,386 --> 00:34:39,906
could you share his contact?

913
00:34:40,306 --> 00:34:41,506
I want to inquire about

914
00:34:41,826 --> 00:34:42,866
licensing this pattern.

915
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,185
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

916
00:34:46,225 --> 00:34:47,946
He stopped making these three years ago.

917
00:34:50,065 --> 00:34:50,545
Why?

918
00:34:51,826 --> 00:34:53,625
Creative block, perhaps?

919
00:34:54,745 --> 00:34:55,466
He's reluctant

920
00:34:55,466 --> 00:34:56,946
to discuss batik.

921
00:34:57,545 --> 00:34:58,946
He even took back

922
00:34:59,065 --> 00:35:00,585
his displayed works.

923
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:05,105
That's so bad.

924
00:35:06,386 --> 00:35:07,185
What a shame.

925
00:35:09,545 --> 00:35:10,866
You can try.

926
00:35:11,986 --> 00:35:12,506
But

927
00:35:12,705 --> 00:35:13,705
I don't know

928
00:35:14,185 --> 00:35:15,145
if he'll agree.

929
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:18,545
(Laxie)

930
00:35:18,545 --> 00:35:19,665
I actually know

931
00:35:20,946 --> 00:35:21,826
Master Chu.

932
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:25,346
You know him?

933
00:35:26,426 --> 00:35:27,145
Years ago,

934
00:35:27,145 --> 00:35:28,826
Jinda ran welfare programs

935
00:35:28,946 --> 00:35:29,866
in Gubei Town

936
00:35:29,866 --> 00:35:31,065
where we delivered supplies.

937
00:35:32,105 --> 00:35:33,866
I delivered supplies to Mr. Chu.

938
00:35:34,625 --> 00:35:36,545
And I saw him again here last year.

939
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:38,665
But he's quite reclusive

940
00:35:38,745 --> 00:35:39,665
and doesn't like

941
00:35:40,185 --> 00:35:41,306
social interactions.

942
00:35:41,585 --> 00:35:42,946
I didn't know that

943
00:35:43,145 --> 00:35:44,386
he was an expert in batik.

944
00:35:45,346 --> 00:35:46,426
If you want to meet him,

945
00:35:46,986 --> 00:35:47,946
I'll go with you.

946
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:03,504
(Cash only,
10 yuan per pile, self-service)

947
00:36:07,026 --> 00:36:07,705
Who is it?

948
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:13,786
Haoming, why are you here?

949
00:36:14,225 --> 00:36:15,265
I brought something.

950
00:36:16,265 --> 00:36:17,065
You're so kind.

951
00:36:17,866 --> 00:36:18,506
And this is?

952
00:36:19,786 --> 00:36:20,346
My friend.

953
00:36:21,585 --> 00:36:22,545
Please, come in.

954
00:36:23,105 --> 00:36:23,786
Thank you.

955
00:36:25,065 --> 00:36:25,866
Take a seat.

956
00:36:26,026 --> 00:36:27,225
Let me make some tea.

957
00:36:42,225 --> 00:36:42,906
Haoming.

958
00:36:43,346 --> 00:36:44,866
It's been so long.

959
00:36:45,426 --> 00:36:45,906
Yeah.

960
00:36:46,545 --> 00:36:47,585
I've been busy with work.

961
00:36:48,466 --> 00:36:49,506
The gardening techniques

962
00:36:50,545 --> 00:36:52,665
you taught me last time

963
00:36:52,986 --> 00:36:53,585
were amazing.

964
00:36:54,185 --> 00:36:55,426
Look at all my plants.

965
00:36:55,665 --> 00:36:56,386
I noticed.

966
00:36:56,906 --> 00:36:57,826
Next time, I'll bring

967
00:36:57,866 --> 00:36:59,065
some gardening books

968
00:36:59,145 --> 00:37:00,185
that you can use.

969
00:37:00,225 --> 00:37:01,105
Thank you.

970
00:37:04,466 --> 00:37:05,665
Your friend here...?

971
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:07,585
Nice to meet you.

972
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:08,466
I'm Xu Yan.

973
00:37:09,306 --> 00:37:10,545
I run a clothing company

974
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:11,946
in Jingzhou.

975
00:37:13,506 --> 00:37:14,745
I'll cut to the chase.

976
00:37:15,705 --> 00:37:16,866
We're currently integrating

977
00:37:16,946 --> 00:37:18,585
intangible cultural heritage

978
00:37:18,665 --> 00:37:19,866
into our designs.

979
00:37:25,946 --> 00:37:28,026
We saw your batik works

980
00:37:28,225 --> 00:37:29,585
at the dyeing workshop.

981
00:37:30,065 --> 00:37:31,265
They're stunning.

982
00:37:31,866 --> 00:37:33,466
It would be meaningful

983
00:37:33,665 --> 00:37:35,346
to feature your patterns

984
00:37:35,705 --> 00:37:37,105
in our latest

985
00:37:37,786 --> 00:37:39,506
batik-inspired collection.

986
00:37:42,545 --> 00:37:43,986
We hope you'll authorize us

987
00:37:45,225 --> 00:37:46,705
to use the patterns.

988
00:37:49,105 --> 00:37:50,026
Haven't you heard?

989
00:37:50,466 --> 00:37:51,506
I quit ages ago.

990
00:37:56,145 --> 00:37:56,705
Then

991
00:37:57,225 --> 00:37:59,745
could we use your previous works?

992
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:01,585
Haoming.

993
00:38:03,786 --> 00:38:05,145
I invited you in

994
00:38:05,185 --> 00:38:06,065
out of respect.

995
00:38:06,466 --> 00:38:07,026
Sir.

996
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:08,386
Please don't be mad.

997
00:38:08,545 --> 00:38:10,386
She was genuinely moved by your work.

998
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:11,346
I'm sorry.

999
00:38:11,506 --> 00:38:11,946
Stop trying

1000
00:38:12,265 --> 00:38:12,946
to fool me.

1001
00:38:13,386 --> 00:38:14,506
My mediocre creations

1002
00:38:14,545 --> 00:38:15,705
couldn't move anyone.

1003
00:38:16,185 --> 00:38:17,105
Let me be honest.

1004
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:18,545
I'd rather let

1005
00:38:18,866 --> 00:38:20,585
my batik works rot at home.

1006
00:38:20,906 --> 00:38:21,426
I don't care.

1007
00:38:21,786 --> 00:38:22,826
I enjoy it.

1008
00:38:24,506 --> 00:38:25,946
I think you should leave.

1009
00:38:26,665 --> 00:38:27,105
Sir.

1010
00:38:27,386 --> 00:38:28,240
Give us a minute.

1011
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,160
- Master Chu, sorry.
- Let her explain.

1012
00:38:36,665 --> 00:38:37,745
I've been thinking.

1013
00:38:38,225 --> 00:38:38,866
Actually,

1014
00:38:39,306 --> 00:38:40,665
I was indeed rude.

1015
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:43,145
I jumped straight into business matters.

1016
00:38:43,466 --> 00:38:44,585
That's why he was

1017
00:38:44,866 --> 00:38:45,906
so irritated

1018
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:46,625
and harsh.

1019
00:38:46,826 --> 00:38:47,625
It's not your fault.

1020
00:38:48,265 --> 00:38:49,265
It only shows

1021
00:38:49,466 --> 00:38:50,265
that he's still

1022
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,065
against batik art.

1023
00:38:52,545 --> 00:38:53,105
But

1024
00:38:53,585 --> 00:38:54,745
he hasn't let go yet.

1025
00:38:54,906 --> 00:38:56,065
I was about to tell you.

1026
00:38:56,346 --> 00:38:57,585
I saw blue-dyed fabrics

1027
00:38:57,786 --> 00:38:58,986
covered by plastic sheets

1028
00:38:59,225 --> 00:39:00,625
in his backyard earlier.

1029
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:03,065
Did you notice the Assam indigo

1030
00:39:03,265 --> 00:39:04,426
soaking in vats?

1031
00:39:05,145 --> 00:39:06,786
That's the botanical dye for blue.

1032
00:39:07,585 --> 00:39:09,105
Why'd someone who hates coriander

1033
00:39:09,386 --> 00:39:10,986
keep it in their fridge?

1034
00:39:14,426 --> 00:39:15,225
Then why...?

1035
00:39:16,386 --> 00:39:17,225
Let's see someone

1036
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:18,466
who knows everything.

1037
00:39:19,866 --> 00:39:20,426
Who?

1038
00:39:20,665 --> 00:39:21,426
Chu

1039
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,105
got divorced three years ago.

1040
00:39:23,466 --> 00:39:24,528
He's just making excuses.

1041
00:39:24,986 --> 00:39:26,466
He blamed it on the divorce

1042
00:39:26,786 --> 00:39:27,585
that he lost

1043
00:39:27,906 --> 00:39:29,026
his inspiration.

1044
00:39:29,506 --> 00:39:30,545
Lost his inspiration?

1045
00:39:30,906 --> 00:39:32,026
How did that happen?

1046
00:39:32,466 --> 00:39:33,105
He lost

1047
00:39:33,105 --> 00:39:34,466
his dyeing partner.

1048
00:39:35,105 --> 00:39:36,545
Chu knows batik techniques

1049
00:39:37,026 --> 00:39:38,065
but indigo dyeing

1050
00:39:38,225 --> 00:39:40,866
is his wife's specialty.

1051
00:39:41,306 --> 00:39:42,946
They were the perfect partners.

1052
00:39:43,225 --> 00:39:43,826
Truth be told,

1053
00:39:44,265 --> 00:39:45,545
her indigo blues

1054
00:39:45,786 --> 00:39:46,545
were mesmerizing.

1055
00:39:47,225 --> 00:39:48,906
If they're such a perfect match,

1056
00:39:48,946 --> 00:39:49,906
why did they divorce?

1057
00:39:50,386 --> 00:39:51,346
His wife

1058
00:39:51,506 --> 00:39:53,105
was a Miao girl from Guizhou.

1059
00:39:53,145 --> 00:39:54,466
She met Chu when she was 19

1060
00:39:54,466 --> 00:39:56,745
while he studied dyeing in her village.

1061
00:39:56,946 --> 00:39:58,545
It was love at first sight.

1062
00:39:58,745 --> 00:39:59,545
She insisted on

1063
00:40:00,145 --> 00:40:00,752
marrying him

1064
00:40:00,826 --> 00:40:02,705
and left her homeland

1065
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:03,625
with him.

1066
00:40:04,506 --> 00:40:05,745
That sounds

1067
00:40:05,866 --> 00:40:06,625
quite romantic.

1068
00:40:07,745 --> 00:40:08,585
Romantic beginning.

1069
00:40:08,946 --> 00:40:09,826
Ugly ending.

1070
00:40:10,306 --> 00:40:11,585
She thought Chu

1071
00:40:11,866 --> 00:40:12,786
was outdated.

1072
00:40:13,185 --> 00:40:13,866
Chu felt that

1073
00:40:14,026 --> 00:40:15,625
she despised his lack of ambition

1074
00:40:16,306 --> 00:40:17,386
and earnings.

1075
00:40:17,745 --> 00:40:19,065
Living with mutual resentment

1076
00:40:19,105 --> 00:40:19,946
doomed

1077
00:40:20,105 --> 00:40:21,545
their marriage.

1078
00:40:21,906 --> 00:40:22,866
So they got divorced

1079
00:40:23,225 --> 00:40:24,306
and cut all ties.

1080
00:40:24,986 --> 00:40:25,906
The painter

1081
00:40:26,145 --> 00:40:26,946
and the dyer

1082
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:28,705
ended up like a pen

1083
00:40:28,745 --> 00:40:29,585
without ink.

1084
00:40:30,065 --> 00:40:30,585
Nonsense.

1085
00:40:30,906 --> 00:40:31,745
Those are excuses.

1086
00:40:31,745 --> 00:40:32,506
Guys are the same.

1087
00:40:33,506 --> 00:40:34,386
No offense.

1088
00:40:36,506 --> 00:40:38,065
From what I just heard,

1089
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:40,466
there are no fundamental issues

1090
00:40:41,426 --> 00:40:42,906
or severe conflicts between them.

1091
00:40:43,265 --> 00:40:43,745
Why

1092
00:40:45,265 --> 00:40:46,185
don't they reconcile?

1093
00:40:49,506 --> 00:40:50,906
Master Chu and his wife

1094
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,466
met due to batik art.

1095
00:40:54,265 --> 00:40:55,506
Now Master Chu refuses

1096
00:40:56,065 --> 00:40:57,225
to produce any artworks.

1097
00:40:57,866 --> 00:40:59,105
He's clearly holding grudges

1098
00:40:59,545 --> 00:41:00,705
against his ex-wife.

1099
00:41:05,225 --> 00:41:06,026
The real pity

1100
00:41:08,026 --> 00:41:09,105
isn't the batik craft,

1101
00:41:09,866 --> 00:41:10,946
but their relationship.

1102
00:41:35,786 --> 00:41:36,545
Caught a cold?

1103
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:39,026
Maybe. It's chilly.

1104
00:41:42,145 --> 00:41:42,986
You're burning up.

1105
00:41:43,346 --> 00:41:44,065
You have a fever.

1106
00:41:45,745 --> 00:41:47,265
It's fine. I'll rest a bit.

1107
00:41:47,265 --> 00:41:48,185
This won't do.

1108
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,866
Ask Dr. Yu to pick you up.

1109
00:41:50,946 --> 00:41:52,265
He's got major surgery today.

1110
00:41:52,306 --> 00:41:53,265
It's just a fever.

1111
00:41:53,585 --> 00:41:54,506
Don't distract him.

1112
00:41:57,105 --> 00:41:58,585
(Yan Studio)
And I can't walk away

1113
00:41:59,145 --> 00:41:59,986
from so much work.

1114
00:42:01,105 --> 00:42:02,866
Is it about the loan?

1115
00:42:04,705 --> 00:42:05,506
I've been talking

1116
00:42:05,545 --> 00:42:07,265
to our suppliers all day,

1117
00:42:07,745 --> 00:42:09,265
asking for payment extensions.

1118
00:42:09,545 --> 00:42:10,466
Nobody would budge.

1119
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:11,745
I'm going crazy.

1120
00:42:12,185 --> 00:42:13,786
What about Mr. Liang's investment?

1121
00:42:15,225 --> 00:42:16,026
Yuanhang wants us

1122
00:42:16,026 --> 00:42:17,466
to expand offline markets.

1123
00:42:17,866 --> 00:42:19,306
That funding is earmarked

1124
00:42:19,506 --> 00:42:20,625
and allocated.

1125
00:42:21,026 --> 00:42:22,265
I've approached several banks

1126
00:42:22,745 --> 00:42:23,705
about loans.

1127
00:42:24,145 --> 00:42:25,906
With Yan Studio's current scale,

1128
00:42:26,705 --> 00:42:28,105
they can approve two million.

1129
00:42:29,866 --> 00:42:30,346
Really?

1130
00:42:30,625 --> 00:42:31,346
Chill.

1131
00:42:32,346 --> 00:42:32,986
Let's see.

1132
00:42:33,225 --> 00:42:33,986
We'll work on it

1133
00:42:34,026 --> 00:42:35,026
if there's progress.

1134
00:42:35,466 --> 00:42:35,986
Alright.

1135
00:42:38,466 --> 00:42:39,906
Let me find a thermometer.

1136
00:42:43,545 --> 00:42:44,466
39.8 Degrees Celsius.

1137
00:42:45,466 --> 00:42:45,826
Lin.

1138
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:46,466
Let's go

1139
00:42:46,705 --> 00:42:47,346
to the hospital.

1140
00:42:47,545 --> 00:42:47,946
Hurry.

1141
00:42:48,105 --> 00:42:49,065
Don't be dramatic.

1142
00:43:01,105 --> 00:43:01,506
Lin.

1143
00:43:02,026 --> 00:43:02,826
You need to rest.

1144
00:43:03,306 --> 00:43:04,625
I'll boil some water for you.

1145
00:43:04,826 --> 00:43:05,585
No need, Lin Tao.

1146
00:43:06,145 --> 00:43:07,105
I got this.

1147
00:43:08,265 --> 00:43:08,866
Could you

1148
00:43:09,105 --> 00:43:10,426
go back to the office

1149
00:43:10,786 --> 00:43:11,866
to fetch my phone?

1150
00:43:11,986 --> 00:43:13,506
Sure, I'll get it for you.

1151
00:43:13,826 --> 00:43:14,745
Take care of yourself.

1152
00:43:15,322 --> 00:43:15,826
(Certificate)

1153
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:16,265
Thanks.

1154
00:43:16,306 --> 00:43:16,826
No problem.

1155
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:22,096
(Yu Yiming)

1156
00:43:31,225 --> 00:43:31,786
Yu Yiming.

1157
00:43:32,145 --> 00:43:32,665
Lin Tao?

1158
00:43:33,906 --> 00:43:34,986
How come it's you?

1159
00:43:35,585 --> 00:43:36,208
Where's Lin?

1160
00:43:36,368 --> 00:43:37,265
She's having a fever.

1161
00:43:37,265 --> 00:43:38,826
We rushed to the hospital

1162
00:43:39,306 --> 00:43:40,185
and I came to pick up

1163
00:43:40,225 --> 00:43:41,065
her phone she left

1164
00:43:41,306 --> 00:43:42,145
at the office.

1165
00:43:42,426 --> 00:43:43,105
Where is she now?

1166
00:43:43,625 --> 00:43:44,265
At home.

1167
00:43:44,786 --> 00:43:45,466
Head there now.

1168
00:43:45,906 --> 00:43:46,545
I'm on my way.

1169
00:43:47,065 --> 00:43:47,986
Meet at her place.

1170
00:43:48,545 --> 00:43:48,946
Okay.

1171
00:43:49,105 --> 00:43:49,786
Be right there.

1172
00:43:55,665 --> 00:43:56,105
Lin Tao.

1173
00:43:56,145 --> 00:43:56,545
Finally.

1174
00:43:56,665 --> 00:43:57,185
Where's Lin?

1175
00:43:57,665 --> 00:43:58,506
In her room.

1176
00:43:58,786 --> 00:43:59,545
Fever's gone down.

1177
00:44:01,826 --> 00:44:02,426
It almost

1178
00:44:02,826 --> 00:44:03,866
turned into pneumonia.

1179
00:44:04,545 --> 00:44:05,105
Her phone.

1180
00:44:05,386 --> 00:44:05,906
Thank you.

1181
00:44:06,466 --> 00:44:07,026
No problem.

1182
00:44:09,225 --> 00:44:09,745
Well,

1183
00:44:10,545 --> 00:44:11,506
don't get me wrong

1184
00:44:12,745 --> 00:44:13,625
for taking her back.

1185
00:44:14,426 --> 00:44:15,625
We're just fellow townsfolk

1186
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:16,625
and coworkers now.

1187
00:44:19,265 --> 00:44:19,745
I won't.

1188
00:44:21,346 --> 00:44:21,986
Good then.

1189
00:44:22,346 --> 00:44:23,786
I left the medicine

1190
00:44:24,026 --> 00:44:24,826
on the table.

1191
00:44:25,346 --> 00:44:25,986
I wrote down

1192
00:44:26,386 --> 00:44:27,145
the dosage.

1193
00:44:27,585 --> 00:44:29,065
You're the doctor. You know better.

1194
00:44:29,705 --> 00:44:30,506
Go ahead.

1195
00:44:30,826 --> 00:44:31,426
I'm off.

1196
00:44:32,625 --> 00:44:33,026
Lin Tao.

1197
00:44:36,986 --> 00:44:38,105
Thank you so much.

1198
00:44:39,585 --> 00:44:40,265
Take care of her.

1199
00:44:41,026 --> 00:44:41,506
Go on.

1200
00:44:52,145 --> 00:44:52,826
Master Chu.

1201
00:44:54,705 --> 00:44:55,906
Why are you here again?

1202
00:44:57,306 --> 00:44:58,225
You're not welcome.

1203
00:44:58,225 --> 00:44:58,786
Master Chu.

1204
00:44:59,065 --> 00:45:00,026
Don't call me master.

1205
00:45:00,026 --> 00:45:00,625
Please.

1206
00:45:00,986 --> 00:45:01,826
I just don't get it.

1207
00:45:02,386 --> 00:45:03,786
There are plenty of dyers around.

1208
00:45:04,665 --> 00:45:05,466
Find someone else.

1209
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:07,426
We...

1210
00:45:08,065 --> 00:45:08,906
Sir.

1211
00:45:11,105 --> 00:45:12,306
Good artworks

1212
00:45:12,506 --> 00:45:13,585
call for sharing.

1213
00:45:14,346 --> 00:45:16,545
If you hide them from people,

1214
00:45:16,906 --> 00:45:17,826
you'll never know

1215
00:45:17,866 --> 00:45:19,185
how others view your work.

1216
00:45:19,665 --> 00:45:20,105
Okay.

1217
00:45:20,185 --> 00:45:21,065
You say you lack

1218
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:22,145
inspiration.

1219
00:45:22,665 --> 00:45:23,265
Then why not

1220
00:45:23,265 --> 00:45:24,426
try to communicate

1221
00:45:24,426 --> 00:45:25,545
with others?

1222
00:45:26,225 --> 00:45:27,145
That's how you infuse

1223
00:45:27,426 --> 00:45:28,946
your creations with vitality.

1224
00:45:31,786 --> 00:45:32,386
Oh boy.

1225
00:45:33,185 --> 00:45:35,026
I don't need your lectures.

1226
00:45:35,946 --> 00:45:38,026
I wouldn't dare lecture you, sir.

1227
00:45:38,306 --> 00:45:39,265
I just want to

1228
00:45:39,306 --> 00:45:40,545
help you break through

1229
00:45:40,625 --> 00:45:41,506
and see if you can

1230
00:45:41,506 --> 00:45:42,946
keep producing artworks.

1231
00:45:44,585 --> 00:45:45,265
Listen.

1232
00:45:45,545 --> 00:45:46,466
New things

1233
00:45:46,665 --> 00:45:48,065
aren't scary at all.

1234
00:45:48,906 --> 00:45:51,265
Modern technology assists humans

1235
00:45:52,105 --> 00:45:53,145
in overcoming confusion

1236
00:45:53,145 --> 00:45:53,986
about creation.

1237
00:45:54,426 --> 00:45:55,426
If you can't weave

1238
00:45:55,466 --> 00:45:56,145
or draw

1239
00:45:56,506 --> 00:45:57,185
certain patterns,

1240
00:45:57,506 --> 00:45:58,585
AI could help with that.

1241
00:45:59,386 --> 00:46:01,346
Technology serves us

1242
00:46:01,665 --> 00:46:02,665
and helps us...

1243
00:46:02,786 --> 00:46:04,306
What nonsense!

1244
00:46:05,145 --> 00:46:05,986
I don't believe

1245
00:46:06,026 --> 00:46:06,745
in AI stuff.

1246
00:46:07,466 --> 00:46:09,705
If computers can replace humans,

1247
00:46:10,386 --> 00:46:11,225
why do you still

1248
00:46:11,506 --> 00:46:12,265
come to me?

1249
00:46:12,665 --> 00:46:14,506
You think creation is that easy?

1250
00:46:15,145 --> 00:46:17,545
Computers can't replace human minds.

1251
00:46:18,625 --> 00:46:20,866
You're not resisting new things.

1252
00:46:21,225 --> 00:46:22,745
You don't want to change, do you?

1253
00:46:24,906 --> 00:46:26,065
You're right.

1254
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:28,225
I won't change.

1255
00:46:30,346 --> 00:46:31,665
I'm successful

1256
00:46:31,946 --> 00:46:34,386
because I stay true to myself.

1257
00:46:34,585 --> 00:46:36,545
I never cater to others' opinions.

1258
00:46:37,065 --> 00:46:38,745
So you're not against batik.

1259
00:46:38,826 --> 00:46:40,426
You're avoiding your true self.

1260
00:46:42,225 --> 00:46:43,386
If you've stopped creating

1261
00:46:44,506 --> 00:46:45,346
batik works,

1262
00:46:45,866 --> 00:46:47,786
what's the indigo in the backyard for?

1263
00:46:50,466 --> 00:46:51,545
You and your ex-wife

1264
00:46:52,346 --> 00:46:53,026
were spouses

1265
00:46:53,145 --> 00:46:54,426
and the best partners.

1266
00:46:56,065 --> 00:46:58,105
Without her color-mixing,

1267
00:47:00,306 --> 00:47:01,225
you'll never find

1268
00:47:01,225 --> 00:47:02,386
that perfect shade of blue.

1269
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:04,225
Is that it?

1270
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:10,585
Enough.

1271
00:47:11,466 --> 00:47:12,346
Don't be so smart.

1272
00:47:12,386 --> 00:47:13,625
I'll tell you the truth.

1273
00:47:13,826 --> 00:47:15,866
I'm out of inspiration.

1274
00:47:17,185 --> 00:47:17,705
Master Chu.

1275
00:47:17,786 --> 00:47:18,386
- Master Chu.
- I...

1276
00:47:35,065 --> 00:47:36,625
So it's not like only his wife

1277
00:47:37,346 --> 00:47:39,265
could create that blue hue.

1278
00:47:39,906 --> 00:47:41,105
In fact, that blue hue

1279
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:43,426
embodies his wife.

1280
00:47:46,705 --> 00:47:47,705
He knows it very well,

1281
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,585
but he refuses to admit it.

1282
00:47:51,386 --> 00:47:52,705
Failing to dye blue

1283
00:47:53,145 --> 00:47:54,466
and lacking inspiration

1284
00:47:55,585 --> 00:47:57,265
are not the real issues.

1285
00:47:58,265 --> 00:47:59,386
Deep down,

1286
00:48:00,185 --> 00:48:01,306
he hasn't let go of her.

1287
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:08,426
You can't

1288
00:48:09,545 --> 00:48:11,185
wake someone pretending to sleep.

1289
00:48:12,426 --> 00:48:14,545
I actually understand him a bit now.

1290
00:48:16,506 --> 00:48:17,705
You think he's right?

1291
00:48:19,466 --> 00:48:20,346
He reminds me

1292
00:48:21,426 --> 00:48:23,026
of who I used to be.

1293
00:48:28,065 --> 00:48:30,986
Extremely self-centered

1294
00:48:32,466 --> 00:48:33,506
and controlling.

1295
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:35,585
Do you remember

1296
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:37,145
how to cultivate agave?

1297
00:48:39,265 --> 00:48:40,026
We can't

1298
00:48:40,026 --> 00:48:41,466
let it grow on its own.

1299
00:48:42,625 --> 00:48:43,585
We have to

1300
00:48:43,625 --> 00:48:45,665
intervene all the time.

1301
00:48:47,946 --> 00:48:48,946
Master Chu is the same.

1302
00:48:50,185 --> 00:48:51,386
He doesn't want to change.

1303
00:48:52,065 --> 00:48:53,105
Once changes occur,

1304
00:48:53,346 --> 00:48:54,426
he becomes uneasy.

1305
00:48:55,386 --> 00:48:56,745
He forces people around him

1306
00:48:56,946 --> 00:48:58,386
to follow his ways.

1307
00:48:59,426 --> 00:49:01,026
So, he didn't get divorced

1308
00:49:02,065 --> 00:49:03,185
because his wife

1309
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:05,705
looked down on his failures.

1310
00:49:06,426 --> 00:49:07,786
He was running away

1311
00:49:08,986 --> 00:49:10,225
from his wife's attempts

1312
00:49:10,826 --> 00:49:12,065
to make him break out

1313
00:49:12,986 --> 00:49:14,866
of his shell and adapt to the changes.

1314
00:49:17,065 --> 00:49:17,906
So?

1315
00:49:19,466 --> 00:49:21,225
Have you cured your need for control?

1316
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:24,426
Still working on it.

1317
00:49:38,346 --> 00:49:38,745
Look.

1318
00:49:39,906 --> 00:49:40,866
See this bridge?

1319
00:49:41,946 --> 00:49:43,466
We've crossed it many times.

1320
00:49:44,386 --> 00:49:45,346
I just never realized

1321
00:49:45,946 --> 00:49:47,466
it looks so beautiful from afar.

1322
00:49:48,506 --> 00:49:50,426
When we rush towards destinations,

1323
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,386
we miss the scenery.

1324
00:49:54,705 --> 00:49:56,026
It's like

1325
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:59,386
how we interact with nature.

1326
00:49:59,786 --> 00:50:00,386
When you stand

1327
00:50:00,426 --> 00:50:01,585
on the bridge,

1328
00:50:01,866 --> 00:50:03,265
it feels like self-reflection.

1329
00:50:03,946 --> 00:50:04,665
But when others

1330
00:50:04,665 --> 00:50:06,386
see you standing there,

1331
00:50:07,145 --> 00:50:08,105
it's a different view.

1332
00:50:09,105 --> 00:50:10,026
That's why

1333
00:50:10,386 --> 00:50:12,225
self-awareness

1334
00:50:12,506 --> 00:50:13,466
isn't easily achieved.

1335
00:50:17,906 --> 00:50:18,745
When was your

1336
00:50:18,786 --> 00:50:19,306
first visit?

1337
00:50:22,105 --> 00:50:22,705
I first

1338
00:50:22,745 --> 00:50:23,906
visited here

1339
00:50:23,946 --> 00:50:25,986
when Haochen was four.

1340
00:50:26,466 --> 00:50:28,426
I came back from my studies abroad
and brought him

1341
00:50:28,545 --> 00:50:29,145
here.

1342
00:50:30,225 --> 00:50:31,625
He must have loved it.

1343
00:50:32,545 --> 00:50:33,145
Yeah.

1344
00:50:34,346 --> 00:50:35,185
He was curious

1345
00:50:35,225 --> 00:50:36,826
about me, the brother

1346
00:50:36,946 --> 00:50:38,306
who had just returned.

1347
00:50:39,026 --> 00:50:40,306
One day, he said he didn't

1348
00:50:40,426 --> 00:50:41,665
want to go to kindergarten.

1349
00:50:42,826 --> 00:50:44,306
So I told Mom that

1350
00:50:44,386 --> 00:50:45,545
I'd take him to school.

1351
00:50:46,225 --> 00:50:48,265
But I drove him out for an adventure.

1352
00:50:48,346 --> 00:50:49,185
And we came here.

1353
00:50:50,105 --> 00:50:50,826
So, Haochen's

1354
00:50:52,826 --> 00:50:53,946
mischievous nature

1355
00:50:54,826 --> 00:50:55,906
is half your fault.

1356
00:50:56,866 --> 00:50:57,506
Fair point.

1357
00:50:58,145 --> 00:50:59,786
I missed much of his growing up.

1358
00:51:00,585 --> 00:51:01,786
That's not entirely true.

1359
00:51:03,225 --> 00:51:04,386
You've done well.

1360
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,786
A child's attitude and reactions

1361
00:51:07,065 --> 00:51:08,065
tell the whole story.

1362
00:51:08,986 --> 00:51:10,026
Haochen adores you

1363
00:51:10,265 --> 00:51:10,986
and relies on you.

1364
00:51:11,906 --> 00:51:12,705
You did well.

1365
00:51:15,225 --> 00:51:16,185
The first time

1366
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:17,506
we came here,

1367
00:51:17,906 --> 00:51:19,506
we had so much fun.

1368
00:51:20,426 --> 00:51:21,466
Everything here

1369
00:51:21,466 --> 00:51:22,306
felt new

1370
00:51:22,786 --> 00:51:24,026
and exciting to me.

1371
00:51:24,906 --> 00:51:25,545
There was this

1372
00:51:25,545 --> 00:51:26,826
amazing ice cream shop.

1373
00:51:27,265 --> 00:51:29,225
He wolfed down two scoops at once

1374
00:51:29,705 --> 00:51:30,826
and made me promise

1375
00:51:32,026 --> 00:51:34,026
not to tell Mom.

1376
00:51:34,946 --> 00:51:35,745
He gave me

1377
00:51:35,745 --> 00:51:36,906
a huge hug

1378
00:51:37,426 --> 00:51:38,185
and a kiss.

1379
00:51:40,946 --> 00:51:41,826
That was

1380
00:51:43,585 --> 00:51:44,986
his first time hugging me.

1381
00:51:47,026 --> 00:51:48,065
It was so warm.

1382
00:51:50,466 --> 00:51:51,545
That's when I realized

1383
00:51:52,585 --> 00:51:53,466
that this town

1384
00:51:54,306 --> 00:51:55,265
could give him

1385
00:51:56,426 --> 00:51:57,105
childhood joys

1386
00:51:57,105 --> 00:51:57,906
that every kid

1387
00:51:57,946 --> 00:51:58,786
deserves

1388
00:51:59,705 --> 00:52:00,386
and help him

1389
00:52:00,426 --> 00:52:01,786
rediscover the nature of a kid.

1390
00:52:03,306 --> 00:52:05,306
Later, I made this town

1391
00:52:05,826 --> 00:52:07,906
his personal paradise.

1392
00:52:08,585 --> 00:52:09,225
I hoped he could

1393
00:52:09,225 --> 00:52:10,466
live like regular kids,

1394
00:52:11,745 --> 00:52:13,185
being mischievous and joyful.

1395
00:52:22,986 --> 00:52:24,466
This place works the same way

1396
00:52:24,585 --> 00:52:25,346
for me.

1397
00:52:25,906 --> 00:52:26,625
It's simple

1398
00:52:27,105 --> 00:52:27,866
and pure.

1399
00:52:28,986 --> 00:52:29,906
No matter

1400
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:30,866
what troubles come,

1401
00:52:32,145 --> 00:52:33,545
whether I argue with my dad

1402
00:52:33,826 --> 00:52:35,265
or face issues at Jinda,

1403
00:52:35,745 --> 00:52:36,426
coming here

1404
00:52:36,745 --> 00:52:37,665
always calms my mind

1405
00:52:37,665 --> 00:52:38,665
like magic.

1406
00:52:40,545 --> 00:52:41,585
That's why I've been

1407
00:52:42,346 --> 00:52:43,866
renovating buildings and facilities

1408
00:52:44,466 --> 00:52:45,426
under Jinda's name

1409
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:47,105
over the years.

1410
00:52:48,026 --> 00:52:49,065
It's not for profit.

1411
00:52:50,346 --> 00:52:51,786
I just hope to make this place

1412
00:52:52,265 --> 00:52:53,145
even better.

1413
00:52:55,866 --> 00:52:56,585
Want to try?

1414
00:53:01,866 --> 00:53:02,346
Like this?

1415
00:53:02,625 --> 00:53:03,105
No.

1416
00:53:03,386 --> 00:53:04,026
Like this.

1417
00:53:05,185 --> 00:53:05,776
Put strength.

1418
00:53:07,665 --> 00:53:08,185
Here we go.

1419
00:53:09,665 --> 00:53:10,026
Come on.

1420
00:53:10,506 --> 00:53:11,088
Put strength.

1421
00:53:11,265 --> 00:53:12,466
Same posture as yours?

1422
00:53:13,386 --> 00:53:14,826
One, two, three.

1423
00:53:14,946 --> 00:53:15,346
Go!

1424
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:17,705
Natural talent.

1425
00:53:17,906 --> 00:53:18,466
